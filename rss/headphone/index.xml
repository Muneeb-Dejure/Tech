    <title>Anker’s latest sleep buds promise to block out snoring partners for longer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anker’s new Soundcore Sleep A20 earbuds in a charging case." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sI6TRT-KdWUzqbqN89b9Y7YRl1g=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73209043/soundcore_Sleep_A20_Lifestyle_image1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker’s new Soundcore Sleep A20 earbuds in a charging case.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G8aWxS"&gt;Anker is revamping its sleep-focused true wireless earbuds with the new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.soundcore.com%2Fpages%2Fsleep-a20-sleeping-earbuds%3Fref%3Dhomepage_master_Banner2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F15%2F24101667%2Fanker-soundcore-sleep-a20-true-wireless-earbuds-white-noise" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Soundcore Sleep A20 model&lt;/a&gt;. It’s announcing the earbuds today to coincide with what is apparently “World Sleep Day” but you won’t be able to buy a pair of the earbuds until its Kickstarter launches on April 16th. Or, if you’d prefer to buy them through more traditional means, they’ll be available via Amazon from May 20th. They’ll ultimately sell for $149.99, but Kickstarter is pricing them at $89.99 for early birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTwaAQ"&gt;Like with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/30/23380435/anker-soundcore-sleep-a10-vr-p10-earbuds"&gt;previous A10 earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, there’s no active noise cancellation here. Instead, the earbuds are equipped with what Anker calls “Twin-Seal eartips” which it claims can block out three times the noise of typical silicon eartips. The earbuds are also designed to play white noise from an “included sound library” in an attempt to further block out external distractions. Anker claims their compact design means they’re comfortable even if you’re someone who likes to sleep on their side.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Woman lies on her side wearing Soundcore Sleep A20." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9r4DWBwxaoqDoO4yBSj1UQJAKiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25337454/soundcore_Sleep_A20_Lifestyle_image5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Soundcore Sleep A20 are designed to be low-profile enough to be comfortable for side-sleepers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q3k8Kh"&gt;Battery life is the A20’s most tangible improvement over its predecessor, with the earbuds now offering up to 14 rather than 10 hours of white noise playback in “Sleep mode,” and up to 80 hours total with their charging case. If you’d like to fall asleep to the sound of music being streamed from your phone, battery life from the earbuds drops to 10 hours, though that’s still an improvement over the 6 hours offered by the A10s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpXFOD"&gt;Other improvements over the first-gen sleep earbuds include a built-in alarm that’s designed to wake you without disturbing anyone sleeping next to you, and support for “automatic sleep monitoring with sleep position tracking.” And if you lose them, you can use their companion app to have the earbuds play an alert to help you fish them out of your bedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQvXLk"&gt;All told, it’s a sensible set of upgrades for Anker’s earbuds, which are launching in the wake of its main competitor Bose choosing to discontinue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review"&gt;its rival Sleepbuds II earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. Three ex-Bose employees are now striking out on their own with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23837206/ozlo-sleepbuds-bose-sleep-earbuds"&gt;Ozlo Sleepbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are in production according to their &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fozlo-sleepbuds-the-next-generation-sleepbuds%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F15%2F24101667%2Fanker-soundcore-sleep-a20-true-wireless-earbuds-white-noise" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Indiegogo page&lt;/a&gt; ahead of an anticipated April ship date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Prince of Persia, Returnal, and other PS hits are up to 50 percent off </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two Persian statues facing each other outside against the sky." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b7f7ntk09B7z5hopXVYqMweCJX4=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73206890/princeofpersia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy &lt;/em&gt;Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&lt;em&gt; for just $30.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ubisoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vGckeD"&gt;What’s with all the good PlayStation deals lately? First, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Console-Marvels-Spider-Man-Bundle-5/dp/B0CKZGY5B6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc-based&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Digital-Marvels-Spider-Man-Bundle-5/dp/B0CV4J3TS7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discless&lt;/a&gt; versions of the PS5 “slim” dropped to an all-time low (with a digital copy of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, no less). Now, Sony is taking up to 80 percent off a ton of PlayStation games through March 27th as part of its &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/9d01f039-7058-43e2-93c2-e462d977dc63/2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essential Picks sale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which drops digital copies of newer hits like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-PPSA10067_00-MEMSTDED00000000"&gt;$29.99 ($20 off)&lt;/a&gt; and both &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA10664_00-FF16SIEA00000002"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-PPSA01576_00-AVATAR2GAME00001"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to $41.99 ($28 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VKcnP7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Final Fantasy XVI adds blood and grit but doesn’t change the series’ soul","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5"},{"title":"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a modern open-world RPG with the soul of 1997 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ih9yCf"&gt;Hundreds of other older games are on sale, too, so you’ll likely find something that’ll strike your fancy if none of the newer games do. Right now, for example, you can challenge yourself for hours on end with either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150718/demons-souls-remake-ps5-playstation-5-sony-game-of-the-year-2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are on sale with their DLC for &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA01284_00-RETURNALDDE00001"&gt;$39.99 ($40 off)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA01342_00-DEMONSSOULSDX000"&gt;$49.49 ($40 off)&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. You can also snag &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Game of the Year Edition&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA02299_00-MARVELSSMGOTY000"&gt;$19.99 ($20 off)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part I&lt;/em&gt; for&lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA03396_00-THELASTOFUSPART1"&gt; $39.89 ($30 off)&lt;/a&gt; if you want to get ahead before diving into their respective sequels. And if you’re after something more relaxing, there’s always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/18/23220428/stray-video-game-review-ps4-ps5-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stray&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(now &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2470-PPSA02100_00-STRAYSIEA0000000"&gt;$19.79&lt;/a&gt;), which has become a hit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23271212/stray-game-cats-watching-twitter-annapurna-interactive"&gt;with humans and cats alike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wKCkW4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12278443"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gLobW4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12036865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NQ55nS"&gt;If you’ve been thinking about picking up a pair of fitness-focused earbuds, &lt;strong&gt;Jabra’s Elite 8 Active &lt;/strong&gt;are available through March 24th from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-Active-Wireless-Earbuds/dp/B0CB9563MB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clPbsE1vVvE"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-8-active/buy/##100-99160701-98"&gt;direct from Jabra&lt;/a&gt; for $159.99 ($40 off). That’s just $10 shy of their all-time low, which we last saw during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tfr6bZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sonos soundbars and speakers are on sale just in time for March Madness","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/14/24100247/sonos-ray-beam-sub-mini-move-2-march-madness-deal-sale"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cz9rMk"&gt;Like their predecessors, the Elite 8 Active feature effective noise cancellation and a design that should allow them to stay firmly in place even during vigorous workouts. The new model boasts an improved IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and meets the military standard for ruggedized electronics, making them even more durable than before. At the same time, they deliver good sound with support for multipoint connectivity and wireless charging. Plus, thanks to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jabra.com%2Fsupport%2Frelease-notes%2Frelease-note-jabra-elite-8-active&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F14%2F24099507%2Fprince-of-persia-ps5-games-jabra-earbuds-anker-511-charger-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a recent OTA software update&lt;/a&gt;, they support better wind detection, which should allow you to cut back on unwanted noise when running outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7hgrQf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12070746" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YEgc9m"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23835595/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-plus-ultra-tablet-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung’s base Galaxy Tab S9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Snapdragon-Processor-Included-Graphite/dp/B0C4BC6R95?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; with 128GB of storage for $679.99 ($120 off), one of its better prices to date. If you’re looking for a speedy Android tablet for entertainment and light productivity, the standard S9 is a terrific option. It’s great for watching movies thanks to its lovely 120Hz OLED display and Dolby Atmos-compatible speakers, the latter of which sound just as good while listening to music. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23835595/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-plus-ultra-tablet-review"&gt;Read our review.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="syq58E"&gt;Now through March 20th, you can pick up a PC copy of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dave the Diver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for $14.99 ($5 off) via &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dave-the-diver-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;H&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-14555742?sid=vergedeals031424&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fdave-the-diver-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;umble&lt;/a&gt;. My colleague Jay Peters said the Nintendo Switch version of the deep diving adventure game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/25/23930889/dave-the-diver-nintendo-switch"&gt;was one of his favorite titles from last year&lt;/a&gt;, with charming characters, stunning pixel art, and a great soundtrack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yzGYZ0"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2F1-or-2-pack-apple-airtag-leather-key-ring-7&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F14%2F24099507%2Fprince-of-persia-ps5-games-jabra-earbuds-anker-511-charger-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is on&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=vergedeals031424&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2F1-or-2-pack-apple-airtag-leather-key-ring-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ce again selling a single&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;AirTag Key Ring&lt;/strong&gt; for $14.99 ($20 off), or a pair for $19.99 ($50 off). This time, though, you can also get an extra $3 off an individual Key Ring or a two-pack when you apply code &lt;strong&gt;TECHDEAL&lt;/strong&gt;, which drops them to $11.99 and $16.99, respectively. Although discontinued, Apple’s leather accessories remain &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882255/apple-iphone-15-finewoven-case-wallet-bad"&gt;far more durable than its new FineWoven options&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to attach them to your belongings longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lVkhUt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ember’s Travel Mug 2 Plus&lt;/strong&gt; is on sale for around $159.99 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ember-Travel-Temperature-Control-Smart/dp/B0CK639YVV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clPjk5xGP0t"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13720150?sid=vergedeals031424&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wayfair.com%2Fkitchen-tabletop%2Fpdp%2Fember-travel-mug-2-12-oz-temperature-control-smart-travel-mug-black-ebdr1009.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wayfair&lt;/a&gt;. Like the standard model, Ember’s newer smart mug can keep your coffee hot all day using the included charging coaster (or for up to three hours using the built-in battery). The Plus model can also tap into Apple’s extensive Find My network, so you can easily locate the 12-ounce vessel using your iPhone, Mac, and other Apple devices should you ever lose it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="id__2ktudjy35sr"&gt;You can buy &lt;strong&gt;Anker’s versatile 511 Charger &lt;/strong&gt;at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Anker-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0CQ551F44?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; starting at $15.99 ($7 off), which matches its all-time low. The USB-C GaN charger can supply phones, tablets, laptops, and other electronics with up to 30W of power, yet it’s also small enough to easily toss in your bag before heading out the door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Grid’s framed, nostalgia-inducing gadgets are up to 40 percent off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/megjC0_X00lY_3IC9cfGXrB4AHw=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73201775/Grid_Game_Boy_Color_Press_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The framed edition of the atomic purple Game Boy Color is nearly $30 off for a limited time.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Grid&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="slYX1w"&gt;Of all the tech-centric artwork I’ve seen over the years, few pieces have grabbed me as much as Grid Studio’s framed gadgets and gizmos. The company has been slinging the collage-like pieces for several years now, taking oft-forgotten devices once destined for the landfill and putting them on full display in classy shadowbox-style frames with exploded views. And now, thanks to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgridstudio.cc%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F12%2F24097671%2Fgrid-studio-framed-tech-sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones-oppenheimer-blu-ray-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;annual spring sales event&lt;/a&gt;, Grid is offering up to 40 percent off select items through the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="pwo4hK"&gt;There are plenty of retro and contemporary items to choose from, from controllers to smartphones to gaming consoles that once dominated the handheld market in the US. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgridstudio.cc%2Fproducts%2Fgrid%25C2%25AE4s&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F12%2F24097671%2Fgrid-studio-framed-tech-sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones-oppenheimer-blu-ray-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone 4S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgridstudio.cc%2Fproducts%2Fgrid%25C2%25AE-nes-controller&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F12%2F24097671%2Fgrid-studio-framed-tech-sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones-oppenheimer-blu-ray-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;original NES controller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— both of which are on sale for $99 ($70 off), matching their all-time low — are the most notable at 40 percent off, though you can also save 15 percent on an assortment of other pieces when you clip the on-page coupon or use promo code &lt;strong&gt;SP15 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.

&lt;p id="L28R31"&gt;Sony has long been a player in the personal audio space, but in the last decade or so, it’s really become known for premium noise-canceling headphones like the &lt;strong&gt;WH-1000XM5&lt;/strong&gt;. Thankfully, if you want to see what all the fuss is about, Amazon is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/0bc5d519/"&gt;hosting an expansive sale&lt;/a&gt; on all things Sony, dropping discounts on headphones, gaming headsets, earbuds, and various pieces of home theater equipment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="k1i8Nx"&gt;On the headphone front, the XM5 are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B0BXYCS74H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $328 ($72 off)&lt;/a&gt;, which matches one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on the over-ears to date. You can also pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-gen WH-1000XM4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which offer an identical set of features, great sound, and a foldable design — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $248 ($100 off)&lt;/a&gt;, along with the step-down &lt;strong&gt;WH-CH720N&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-CH720N-Canceling-Headphones-Microphone/dp/B0BS74M665?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$128 ($22 off)&lt;/a&gt;. Last but not least are the &lt;strong&gt;LinkBuds S&lt;/strong&gt;, a pair of wireless earbuds that offer supreme comfort, strong voice call performance, and effective ANC &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-LinkBuds-Wireless-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B09YL76VSR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $148 ($52 off)&lt;/a&gt;. You can even snag the purple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23889814/sony-olivia-rodrigo-linkbuds-s-announced-guts-sour"&gt;Olivia Rodrigo edition&lt;/a&gt; of the latter &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-LinkBuds-Wireless-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0CHZ8J9LC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for an all-time low of $168&lt;/a&gt; ($32 off), which nets you two custom EQ modes that are optimized for each of Rodrigo’s albums: &lt;em&gt;Sour&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="96hJhc"&gt;One of the coolest things about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23765921/google-pixel-tablet-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel Tablet&lt;/a&gt; is its color-matched speaker dock, which attaches via magnets and allows you to use your slate as an ad hoc smart display. The tablet comes with one by default; however, if you’d like a second &lt;strong&gt;Charging Speaker Dock&lt;/strong&gt; to place somewhere else in your home, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C289CD17/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clOqAIewHjA"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the standalone device starting at $77.99 ($51 off).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lpabrg"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apple’s latest AirPods Pro &lt;/strong&gt;— aka the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best pair of earbuds for iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; or anyone locked into the Apple ecosystem — have returned to their all-time low of around $189 ($60 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0CHWRXH8B/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C%2F5020133971%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clOqFPs8sJz"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The newest model touts the same great sound quality and ANC as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23365910/apple-airpods-pro-second-generation-review"&gt;second-gen model&lt;/a&gt; from 2022, except the latest iteration also features dust resistance and ships with a USB-C charging case instead of the Lightning-only model that came with Apple’s previous earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review"&gt;Read our hands-on impressions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="78y805"&gt;2023 was a colossal year for gaming, with blockbuster titles such as &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate 3, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leading the public discourse. If you didn’t have a chance to tackle the excellent &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lies of P&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, however, the PC version is on sale via &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.humblebundle.com/store/lies-of-p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt; for $44.99 ($15 off). The action RPG is essentially a bloody gothic reimagining of &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;with a punishing learning curve, the kind best suited for fans of &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;, and other difficult games that leave you more and more deflated with every session (sigh).&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s inexpensive smart thermostat has fallen to its best price in months </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The white Amazon Smart Thermostat mounted to a wall." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1SJpucZL8kxm6jPIV1TEiUQJGm4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73183432/jtuohy_211115_4885_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s apt-titled thermostat can learn your habits over time and supports Alexa.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ma04N4"&gt;While the days are getting brighter, spring isn’t set to arrive for another few weeks. Given &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-03-02/another-wet-weekend-as-new-storm-hits-southern-california-how-long-will-it-rain"&gt;we’re still dealing with storms&lt;/a&gt; in “sunny” Southern California, I’m going to venture a guess that it probably doesn’t feel like winter’s almost over where most of our readers live, either. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22791333/amazon-smart-thermostat-review-learning-geofencing-hunches"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon’s Smart Thermostat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is on sale right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Thermostat/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $59.99 ($20 off), its lowest price in nearly three months and the best deal we’ve seen outside of Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vCaH4Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How my smart home almost saved my vacation","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/23/23800964/smart-home-smart-thermostat-alerts-saved-my-vacation"},{"title":"How Ecobee is becoming the smart home company Nest should have been","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23919520/ecobee-smart-doorbell-camera-smart-home-ecosystem-smart-energy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8cey6"&gt;Amazon’s budget-friendly smart thermostat offers an impressive set of features for the price. It’s compatible with most 24-volt HVAC systems and adapts to your habits and preferences over time thanks to its support for Hunches, which lets you essentially turn it on and forget about it like you would with a pricier thermostat. It’s helpful in other ways, too, especially since it integrates well with Amazon Alexa and can even reduce your heating and cooling bills. So long as you can do without native temperature sensors and support for voice assistants beyond Alexa, it’s not a bad investment to make at just $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="9MvIa3"&gt;

&lt;p id="lh4N6X"&gt;Up until now, the only way to save on the Samsung Galaxy S24 was through promotions that involved storage upgrades and gift cards. While nice, sometimes a straight-up cash discount is more helpful. Fortunately, we’re now seeing the first cash discounts on Samsung’s Galaxy S24 lineup. The 6.2-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24058916/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review-screen-battery-camera"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy S24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now starts at $699.99 ($100 off) with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDRCZBJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clLL6q4zjlF"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, while the 6.7-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24058916/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review-screen-battery-camera"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy S24 Plus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; starts at $849.99 ($150 off) with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDL3H3V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clLL4xhHe85"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. You can also pick up the 6.8-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24053907/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review-ai-screen-camera-battery"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy S24 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDM65JH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clLvirxENzz"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,149.99 ($150 off). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FvoGY5"&gt;Samsung’s latest phones come with the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip and a range of AI-powered features, including generative photo editing and live language translation for phone calls. Samsung also promises seven major Android upgrades and security updates no matter which phone you buy. The S24 Plus sports a larger higher-res screen than the standard S24 and more RAM, but the Ultra is the most capable of the bunch. The latter comes with an S Pen, a better camera system, a titanium build, and an effective anti-glare coating.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s certainly not going to be as snappy and only supports a single external display as opposed to two, but the laptop sports excellent battery life and is still more than fast enough for everyday computing needs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

The inexpensive air quality monitor is a better buy than it was when we first reviewed it, thanks to the fact it can now turn on smart thermostats, air purifiers, and other connected devices via Alexa Routines when it detects a drop in air quality. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22971411/amazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-iaq-review"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="Brwftw"&gt;If you’re looking for a relatively inexpensive pair of noise-canceling headphones, right now, you can buy &lt;strong&gt;Sony’s WH-CH720N &lt;/strong&gt;in black for $105.98 ($44 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS1QCFHX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

Along with three USB-A ports and six outlets that can power your devices reliably enough, the power strip monitors your energy usage so you can cut costs if needed. It also supports Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant for voice control.  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p id="RSkEU2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geK4Gk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkY2U1"&gt;If you want to reliably hit headshots and combos on your smartphone, there’s no substitute for a mobile gaming controller that adds proper physical controls. Our favorite for the task is still the &lt;strong&gt;Backbone One&lt;/strong&gt;, and now through March 10th, you can save 30 percent on the original Lightning version in black, which is down to $69.99 ($30 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-iOS-Mobile-Gamepad-Controller-Certified/dp/B08RL7VLKY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbackbone-one-mobile-gaming-controller-for-iphone-black-lightning%2F-%2FA-86824580&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and direct from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone-one%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F4%2F24090012%2Fbackbone-one-mobile-gaming-controller-apple-ipad-air-sony-wh-1000xm4-headphones-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1733403&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=107979&amp;amp;urllink=playbackbone%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone%2Done%2F&amp;amp;afftrack=vergeroundupdeals030424" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bone. Yo&lt;/a&gt;u can also pick up the PlayStation Edition, which comes in white and has button labels corresponding to Sony’s controllers, for $69.99 ($30 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-iOS/dp/B09ZXTRKQ9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbackbone-one-mobile-gaming-controller-for-iphone-playstation-edition-white-lightning%2F-%2FA-86824579&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone-one-playstation%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F4%2F24090012%2Fbackbone-one-mobile-gaming-controller-apple-ipad-air-sony-wh-1000xm4-headphones-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5lGkZ3"&gt;The original Backbone One supports the iPhone 14 and older, Lightning-based models. (If you own an iPhone 15 variant, you’ll need the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-iOS/dp/B0CCT2TJW4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Backbone One with USB-C&lt;/a&gt;, which isn’t on sale.) It gives your smartphone a stable cradle and flanks it with standard gaming controls that make mobile titles much easier to play, and it includes a 3.5mm headphone jack so you can use wired headphones to enjoy game audio, plus a microphone for chatting. The Backbone One’s buttons don’t have the same satisfying travel and feel as more substantial controllers, but it beats losing focus and having your fingers take up half the screen as you peck around for software controls. It’s also compatible with Backbone’s software, which can help you organize your mobile games and streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re not interested in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23990883/apple-ipad-air-oled-pro-spring-release-12-9-inch"&gt;rumored embiggening of the iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; before hearing official details, however, you can save a bit by picking up the &lt;strong&gt;fifth-gen iPad Air&lt;/strong&gt;, which is receiving a $150 discount in various storage configurations. The 64GB / Wi-Fi model is available for around $449 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09V3HN1KC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clLpCdhsXni"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fjobs%2Fsearch%2F%3FcurrentJobId%3D3804718189%26geoId%3D103644278%26keywords%3Decommerce%2520remote%26location%3DUnited%2520States%26origin%3DJOB_SEARCH_PAGE_SEARCH_BUTTON%26refresh%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeroundupdeals030424" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, while the 256GB / Wi-Fi model starts at $599.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09V3H386P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clLpw8De7Ce"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-air-10-9-inch-wi-fi-only-2022-5th-generation%2F-%2FA-86136914&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Each matches its respective all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bcDeaq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"The best iPad to buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23639378/best-ipad-apple-buy-model-price"},{"title":"You can now preorder the new M3-powered MacBook Air","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24090194/apple-m3-macbook-air-13-15-inch-2024-preorder-how-to-buy-release-date-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="32LTSH"&gt;Released in 2022, the fifth-gen Air was first in the line to use Apple’s M1 chipset, which gives it power comparable to the 2021 iPad Pro. It even resembles the more substantial Pro models in terms of hardware design and borrows a few of its features, including a 12-megapixel camera with Center Stage and a USB-C port. In fact, the Air’s 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display fits into a chassis with roughly the same dimensions as the 11-inch iPad Pro (both are even compatible with the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPdc1E"&gt;Compared to Pro models, the iPad Air lacks a lidar camera and Face ID (it uses Touch ID for biometric unlocking). It’s also missing the Pro’s 120Hz ProMotion variable refresh rate display, along with the Mini LED panel found on the 12.9-inch model. There are fewer total speakers, too, with just two compared to the Pro’s four. Otherwise, though, it has all the essentials needed to enjoy iPadOS in a comfortably wieldable form factor, including support for the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Apple Pencil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zCCdN7"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/23/23316900/steelseries-arena-3-7-9-gaming-pc-playstation-speakers-wireless-mic-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SteelSeries Arena 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2.1-channel gaming speakers are&lt;/strong&gt; down to $219.99 ($80 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arena-Computer-Gaming-Speakers/dp/B09KNYJL4R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clLpDRL8PWS"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is the best price we’ve seen. The package includes two speakers with four-inch drivers and programmable RGB lighting that responds to the game you’re playing, along with a 6.5-inch down-firing subwoofer. It connects to PCs and PlayStation consoles via USB-A, but it also accepts optical and 3.5mm, and there’s Bluetooth to stream music from your smartphone and other devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NpfLOf"&gt;Tablets, smartphones, and many lightweight laptops often don’t support a robust selection of ports to connect peripherals and accessories. If you don’t mind adding an extra piece of gear to your bag, you can solve that with items like &lt;strong&gt;Anker’s PowerExpand 6-in-1 USB-C hub&lt;/strong&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerExpand-Adapter-Delivery-MacBook/dp/B096LV7W9D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling for $19.99 ($20 off). It has a 4K-capable HDMI port, 100W Power Delivery USB-C, two USB-A 3.0 ports, an SD card slot, and a 3.5mm audio jack. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nO4jTf"&gt;If you want a great pair of over-ear headphones with long battery life (30 hours) and very effective noise cancellation, &lt;strong&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4s &lt;/strong&gt;are still some of the best you can buy — even if the newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23067645/sony-wh-1000xm5-noise-canceling-headphones-review"&gt;XM5s&lt;/a&gt; have since supplanted them on our list of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. The last-gen headphones are down to $248 ($100 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-Phone-Call/dp/B08MVGF24M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clLpEchWhap"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is only $20 more than their all-time low. They build on their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17844914/sony-1000x-m3-review-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;excellent-sounding predecessors&lt;/a&gt; with quality-of-life changes like multipoint, USB-C charging, and Google Fast Pair. They also have a speak-to-chat feature, which pauses playback when you’re speaking, and real-time AI audio enhancements. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MW4qNo"&gt;You can currently buy &lt;strong&gt;Anker’s 100W 736 GaN II charger&lt;/strong&gt; for $42.99 ($32 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Pixelbook-ThinkPad/dp/B09Q52CXX1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The charger features two USB-C Power Delivery ports that are both capable of 100W charging (if there’s just one device plugged in) and a USB-A 3.0 port that maxes out at 22.5W. The device’s small size and weight (7.2 ounces), along with the fold-up AC wall plug, make it a suitable charger for both home use and travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Apple is taking up to $150 off the Beats Studio Pro and Studio Buds Plus </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A product photo of the Beats Studio Pro noise-canceling headphones." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jAI-ntoMU8jfcEu0HvhYsdI8a34=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73177770/DSCF2651_Enhanced_NR.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple-owned Beats Studio Pro support both iOS and Android devices.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0mQ5BY"&gt;Apple rarely discounts its own products, which is why I was pleasantly surprised to find Apple welcoming the weekend with some terrific deals on Beats headphones and earbuds. Both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23799799/beats-studio-pro-review-apple-google-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beats Studio Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23725921/beats-studio-buds-plus-earbuds-review-translucent-clear"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beats Studio Buds Plus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are down to some of their best prices to date, with numerous third-party retailers matching Apple’s pricing. That means you can pick up the Beats Studio Pro for $199.95 ($150 off) directly from &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQTP3LL/A/beats-studio-pro-wireless-headphones-black"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, or at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PWSW7T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clJ7Z4yFFbS"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for around the same price. The Beats Studio Buds Plus, meanwhile, can be had starting at $129.95 ($40 off) from &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQLK3LL/A/beats-studio-buds-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-transparent"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZK2Z2TC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clzWUFnIqXG"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XXKeWH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"These leaked Beats Solo 4 renders look awfully similar to the Solo 3s","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24085020/these-leaked-beats-solo-4-renders-look-awfully-similar-to-the-solo-3s"},{"title":"Apple’s wearable ideas include smart glasses and cameras in your ears","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/25/24082760/apple-smart-glasses-airpods-cameras-smart-ring"},{"title":"This DIY AirPods Max mod means you can stop waiting for a USB-C upgrade","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/28/24085141/apple-airpods-max-usb-c-ken-pillonel-mod"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HlUXJL"&gt;Compared to Apple’s AirPods lineup, the Studio Pro and Studio Buds Plus offer more flexibility, with native support for both iOS and Android software features. The Studio Pro are also Apple’s first over-ear headphones to support lossless audio over USB-C, while the Studio Buds Plus arrive in multiple colors — including a see-through option that’s more eye-catching than any AirPods model to date. Both fall short of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review"&gt;second-gen AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to noise cancellation and transparency modes, however, and you do lose out on some iOS tricks, including audio sharing. Still, both deliver better sound, ANC, and battery life than the prior models, making them a worthwhile upgrade overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="Q68YXv"&gt;Read our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23799799/beats-studio-pro-review-apple-google-features"&gt;Beats Studio Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23725921/beats-studio-buds-plus-earbuds-review-translucent-clear"&gt;Beats Studio Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; reviews.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p id="wFG7Vo"&gt;If you’re planning on traveling over spring break, buying a Bluetooth tracker to keep tabs on your luggage can provide some extra peace of mind. And right now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23769840/best-bluetooth-trackers"&gt;one of our favorite models&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;strong&gt;Eufy’s SmartTrack Card &lt;/strong&gt;— is down to an all-time low of $16.99 ($13 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-SmartTrack-Resistant-Thickness-Supported/dp/B0BKJZ5BVF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1799333-REG%2Feufy_security_t87b2011_smart_tracker_card_for.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F2%2F24087574%2Fbeats-studio-pro-buds-plus-eufy-smarttrack-card-item-tracker-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PYGuKv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"We might be waiting a while for the next version of AirTags","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23817520/apple-airtags-2-mass-production"},{"title":"Samsung’s SmartTag2 is smaller and lasts longer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/5/23902100/samsung-smarttag2-item-tracker-announce"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eXuzit"&gt;Eufy’s location trackers are good options for iOS users looking for a cheaper AirTag-alternative. That’s because they’re also compatible with Apple’s extensive Find My network, which allows for impressively precise tracking along with &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;support for unwanted tracking alerts&lt;/a&gt;. The biggest difference between Eufy’s trackers and Apple’s is that they’re credit card-shaped, so you can easily slip them into your wallet or passport holder. Sadly, they don’t sport user-replaceable batteries, but they do come with a small and handy clip attachment, so you can attach them to your laptop and other valuables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BrjncC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:11943733" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OyVt8M"&gt;Other ways to save this weekend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Y5qSe6"&gt;Now through March 31st, the &lt;strong&gt;first-gen Sonos Move&lt;/strong&gt; is available for around $279 ($120 off) from &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/move" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.costco.com/sonos-move-portable-wireless-speaker.product.4000177623.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco (if you’re a member)&lt;/a&gt;. The large speaker may not offer stereo sound or in-line playback like the newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23877274/sonos-move-2-review"&gt;Sonos Move 2&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s still loud enough to fill most rooms. It also supports Google Assistant, unlike the Move 2, which was forced to drop the feature due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23910694/sonos-google-patent-verdict-thrown-out-alsup"&gt;an ongoing legal dispute with Google&lt;/a&gt;. As a bonus, Costco’s deal also includes a promo code you can use to get a free &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/travel-bag" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Move case&lt;/a&gt;, along with a coupon that’ll take 30 percent off Sonos accessories. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871409/sonos-move-wireless-bluetooth-speaker-review-alexa-google-assistant-wifi-price-specs-sound-quality"&gt;Read our review.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Jgq3S"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Amazon’s latest Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/strong&gt; is down to its second-best price of $39.99 ($20 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clJ9PWsiODY"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 shy of its all-time low. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review"&gt;last-gen model&lt;/a&gt;, the streaming device offers Wi-Fi 6E support and double the storage while maintaining support for HDR10 and HDR10 Plus. You can also set it to display Alexa widgets for calendar alerts and other reminders, or simply use it to display artwork when idle. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z6Atb3"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Roborock Q5 Pro &lt;/strong&gt;is available for around $319.97 ($110 off) from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7VLHMQR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (when you clip the on-page coupon) and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.roborock.com%2Fproducts%2Froborock-q5-pro-robot-vacuum-and-mop&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F2%2F24087574%2Fbeats-studio-pro-buds-plus-eufy-smarttrack-card-item-tracker-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roborock&lt;/a&gt;. The midrange robot vacuum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner"&gt;is one of our favorites&lt;/a&gt; thanks to its 5,200 Pa of suction power and dual rubber brushes, the latter of which pick up pet hair and dirt exceptionally well. It can’t empty itself, but it does sport a large bin and lidar mapping and navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vsV0zF"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is on sale at &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clJ6Hx5Bxd5"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; in its “fiesta red” colorway with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for $299 ($400 off), its lowest price to date. It’s not the most powerful Chromebook given it only packs a 10th Gen Intel Core i3-10110U processor, but it has a gorgeous QLED panel and long battery life, rendering it fine for everyday computing needs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Read our review.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yM3uHV"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just Dance 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is down to $19.99 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clKwUMqzZOv"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for the Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5. The fitness game makes working out from home fun, inviting players to dance to new hits and classics from Bad Bunny, Miley Cyrus, and even Whitney Houston.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>

      &lt;img alt="An iPhone and pair of third-gen AirPods." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VeWoDBHlSeZ_zkRX7eFP41dQ27s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/IMG_0049_2.32.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjCYhY"&gt;If you know where to look, there are often some great discounts available on Apple’s ever-popular AirPods. Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; toward the end of 2021, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model slowly dip to around $100. And now that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23327631/apple-airpods-pro-new-second-gen-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;second-gen AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; has been on the market for over a year, we’re also seeing their price fall more often, too. We’re even seeing great deals land on the newer updated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review"&gt;AirPods Pro with USB-C&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cAewsn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price"},{"title":"Apple’s wearable ideas include smart glasses and cameras in your ears","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/25/24082760/apple-smart-glasses-airpods-cameras-smart-ring"},{"title":"This DIY AirPods Max mod means you can stop waiting for a USB-C upgrade","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/28/24085141/apple-airpods-max-usb-c-ken-pillonel-mod"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E6INSh"&gt;Here, we’ve curated the best deals currently available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hh97yA"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.sbnation.com/csk/uploads/verge-toc.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;

//this line summons a table of contents. use as follows!

//initiateTOC takes the arguments "header", "subheader", "collapsible"

//for whatever header type ("h2", "h3" etc) you want to be the main header, type it in quotes in the function call. 

//if you don't want subheads, set to false in the function call (no quotes)

//collapsible is a true/false toggle

//if you want a specific, unlinked title just add a string at the end in double quotes, e.g. false, "h3", false, "This is the title"

//see graham if you have any questions/issues

// note that all the header types are off by one: an h1 in the CMS is an h2 in the actual code. If you just want h2 and h3 to show up in the TOC you need to call them h3 and h4. 


window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) =&gt; {
	initiateTOC("h2", "h3", false, "The best AirPods deals")
});


&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;In 2021, Apple lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — from $159 to $129. It now only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found that the easy-to-use, second-gen AirPods still offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="07GZLr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d18DWW"&gt;For Black Friday, Apple’s most affordable pair of earbuds dropped to an all-time low of $69 ($60 off) at Walmart and other retailers. For now, however, the second-gen earbuds with a Lightning charging case are on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=verge021424" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clDiIYwVGc3"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for about $99, a $30 discount. The model with the wireless charging case, meanwhile, is &lt;a href="https://howl.me/cjyYOe4WqSs"&gt;on sale at Adorama&lt;/a&gt; for $119.99 ($30 off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="wPz1Z4"&gt;

&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;With support for the company’s MagSafe technology and an asking price of $179, Apple’s third-gen AirPods are often considered the middle child in Apple’s current AirPods lineup. The shorter stems make for a more subtle design, too, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="orderTotalOutput"&gt;In 2022, Apple quietly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23341651/apple-airpods-third-gen-charging-case-lightning-magsafe"&gt;introduced a new, slightly cheaper option&lt;/a&gt; of the third-gen AirPods that comes with a Lightning-only charging case, which are currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Lightning-Resistant-Headphones/dp/B0BDHB9Y8H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clDiMlKt0Gu"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $149.99 ($20 off).

&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;Apple announced the second-gen AirPods Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23341046/apple-iphone-14-plus-pro-max-notch-event-announcements-watch-8-se-ultra-airpods-pro"&gt;during its “Far Out” event in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, a pair of earbuds that feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation. They also sport swipe-based controls, come with Apple’s new H2 chip, and feature an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Zaa6jO"&gt;During last year’s “Wonderlust” event, Apple also announced an updated version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review"&gt;AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case&lt;/a&gt; and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The new model also comes with lossless audio support when used with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price"&gt;Apple’s new Vision Pro&lt;/a&gt; headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVsUVN"&gt;You can currently buy the updated AirPods Pro for $189 ($60 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0CHWRXH8B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C%2F5020133971&amp;amp;subid1=verge021424" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Woot and other retailers have discounted the AirPods Max to as low as $409 in the past. Right now, though, the best you can do is buy the AirPods Max for $479.99 ($100 off) in select colors at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Headphones-Cancelling-Transparency-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B08PZJ8FZ8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clxQFAS9td5"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Max-Space-Gray%2F509451094&amp;amp;subid1=verge021424" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Google’s 256GB Pixel Tablet is on sale for its best price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pixel Tablet in dark green and off-white." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Y_jZfltv2VPrr7-00unJYyfVzc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73171179/google_pixel_tablet_hands_on_17.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you own a Pixel smartphone or smartwatch, the Pixel Tablet makes for a great trifecta.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NJE2gT"&gt;It’s easy to default to iPads and Samsung Galaxy Tabs when shopping for a new tablet, but believe it or not, there are other devices worth your consideration. Take the &lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel Tablet&lt;/strong&gt;, for instance, which is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1SKS79W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clJhU0LSq8U"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; in the 256GB configuration for $449 ($150 off) — a record low for the higher storage model. In fact, the current discount makes the larger model cheaper than the $499.99 base model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tnbdd5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s new Pixel Tablet might be the end of the smart display ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23720333/google-pixel-tablet-smart-home-display-io"},{"title":"Google’s seven-year Pixel update promise is historic — or meaningless ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23904092/google-pixel-update-seven-years-editorial"},{"title":"The best iPad to buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23639378/best-ipad-apple-buy-model-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hGw0mz"&gt;The Pixel Tablet’s 11-inch 16:10 display isn’t as comfortable as a 4:3 device for reading or browsing, but it works great as a multimedia consumption device, especially when you attach it to the fabric-wrapped speaker dock that comes with the tablet. The bundled speaker dock sounds pretty good, and playback will automatically resume over the tablet’s four speakers when it’s dislodged. And while not as robust as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24078558/echo-hub-review-alexa-amazon-smart-control-panel"&gt;a proper smart home hub&lt;/a&gt;, it provides one-touch access to basic smart home controls and other quick settings. It also holds the tablet at an ideal angle for video calling with its 8-megapixel, 1080p front camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUt79J"&gt;There’s not much more to the Pixel Tablet. It uses Google’s Tensor G2 chip that’s tuned to run Android at its best. Games, apps, browsing, and multimedia are all smooth experiences. It does get a little hot, however, and Android still doesn’t feel as right for these big slates as iPadOS does. You can run apps in split-screen mode and the apps designed specifically for tablets are very nice, but that catalog is still thin compared to the competition. It’s just a good midrange tablet, but that may be all some of you need. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23765921/google-pixel-tablet-review"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J91r0o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12091461" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l3iRcO"&gt;I’m a simple guy: I see Sonic, I go zoom. There aren’t many other platformer games that give you the same sense of speed. Fortunately, you can take control of the beloved blue hedgehog in more than a dozen games with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sonic Origins Plus,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a classic collection that’s down to around $20 ($20 off) at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fsonic-origins-plus---playstation-5%2F392266.html&amp;amp;u1=vergeroundupdeals022824" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSonic-Origins-Plus-PlayStation-5%2F2614599910&amp;amp;subid1=vergeroundupdeals022824" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for the Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HKgYM5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Gotta go... check out this really neat Sonic 2 video","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23998659/gotta-go-check-out-this-really-neat-sonic-2-video"},{"title":"Sonic Superstars is so close to being a Sonic classic","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23934858/sonic-superstars-review-impressions-switch-playstation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DvboNU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic Origins Plus&lt;/em&gt; includes four remastered classic titles — specifically the original &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sonic 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sonic 3 and Knuckles&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Sonic CD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;— &lt;/em&gt;and you can play as Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, Amy, and other characters, depending on the game. The expansive collection also has 12 &lt;em&gt;Sonic&lt;/em&gt; games that launched for the Sega Game Gear (which you might not know of because most of us played Game Boy back then).&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Purists can stick to the games’ original resolution with limited lives, but you can also toggle on a wide-screen HD mode with unlimited lives, allowing you to practice your speed-running technique without worrying about losing your rings. The games feature new stages, missions, modes, and music as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w9Adpi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12264860" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="hKHvbj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on X","description":"Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="RsQYQt"&gt;More deals and discounts of note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Q8PvRU"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://howl.me/clJjfV0r7Od"&gt;Eufy is currently selling&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;Robovac 11S Max&lt;/strong&gt; for just $149.99 ($100 off) when you apply offer code &lt;strong&gt;WS24T2108111 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. The aging robot vacuum is as basic as bump-and-run bots get, with an accompanying remote and no app. That said, it’s not a bad buy if all you need is a small, simple robovac with good suction that gets the job done. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="quGzXS"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sennheiser’s IE 200&lt;/strong&gt; are down to just $95.98 (about $55 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRPR38JR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is a new all-time low. The comfortable, wired earbuds sound really good, and unlike their wireless contemporaries, they’ll last as long as the device they’re plugged into. That said, the detachable braided cable doesn’t have an inline microphone, so they’re not great for call-heavy days. You also might want to spend the extra savings on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=3.5mm+dongle&amp;amp;crid=262CFYBVSRYRX"&gt;3.5mm dongle&lt;/a&gt; since many modern devices lack an audio jack. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23594458/sennheiser-ie-200-wired-earbuds-iem-review-features"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TNy0md"&gt;You can get &lt;strong&gt;NuPhy’s Air75&lt;/strong&gt; for $99.99 ($10 off) at &lt;a href="https://nuphy.com/products/air75"&gt;NuPhy&lt;/a&gt;. The hot-swappable wireless keyboard recently earned a spot on our list of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23384750/best-mechanical-keyboard-wired-wireless-75-percent-layout-cheap-bluetooth"&gt;best mechanical keyboards&lt;/a&gt; for its stature, appearance, and low-profile keying. It’s an attractive centerpiece for a minimalist desk setup, and it can connect via Bluetooth or a 2.4GHz wireless dongle (or USB if you want zero latency) to Macs and Windows PCs. It ships with your choice of red, blue, or brown Gateron 2.0 switches, letting you choose the tactile feel and sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qlzSVh"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Anker’s 553 USB-C Hub&lt;/strong&gt; is available for an all-time low of $42.49 (about $28 off) from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerExpand-Adapter-Delivery-Ethernet/dp/B0874M3KW4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clJjbKZBbCy"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt;, the latter with promo code &lt;strong&gt;WS7DMQPDVY&lt;/strong&gt;. The 8-in-1 dock is equipped to handle heavy workflows with dual 4K HDMI ports (up to 60Hz with one display connected or 30Hz with two), a 100W USB-C Power Delivery port with 85W passthrough charging, SD and micro SD readers, an ethernet port, and two USB-A 3.0 ports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iQpD2A"&gt;Now through March 9th, &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=vergeroundupdeals022824&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Fplus%2Fapple-watches-24" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is selling several &lt;strong&gt;refurbished Apple Watches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; starting at $129.99. The newest models include the original Apple Watch Ultra (now &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=vergeroundupdeals022824&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-watch-ultra-grade-a-refurbished-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$502.99&lt;/a&gt;), Series 7 (&lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=vergeroundupdeals022824&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-watch-series-7-grade-a-refurbished-10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now $205.99&lt;/a&gt;), and second-gen Apple Watch SE (&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=vergeroundupdeals022824&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-watch-se-2nd-gen-grade-a-refurbished" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now $161.99&lt;/a&gt;). You can choose between varying sizes and colors, as well as GPS or LTE connectivity, when available. Woot says these watches have minimal cosmetic damage that’s hard to notice unless you’re looking closely, and the batteries have retained at least 85 percent of their original capacity. Each purchase comes with a one-year limited warranty, which makes it easier to take a chance.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>This DIY AirPods Max mod means you can stop waiting for a USB-C upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing the AirPods Max with USB-C" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uUGsXbqmllpxhrBwsQuU0YC076g=/282x0:2565x1522/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73170146/airpods_max_mod.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ken Pillonel &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnw56zHnydE" target="_blank"&gt;via YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o7s9zM"&gt;For AirPod Max owners, engineer Ken Pillonel has beaten Apple to the punch by swapping the four-year-old headphones from a Lightning port to USB-C. In &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnw56zHnydE"&gt;a new video posted to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, Pillonel shows how to install his custom printed circuit board (PCB) with USB-C support without drilling any new holes, as well as how he designed it to fit comfortably inside the headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe55Oe"&gt;He’s &lt;a href="https://shop.kenp.io/products/41rp0d-max-usb-c-flex"&gt;made the board&lt;/a&gt; available for purchase on his website for around $45, along with &lt;a href="https://docs.kenp.io/airpods-max/usb-c-kit/v1_assembly/"&gt;detailed installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; — if you feel brave enough to mod &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;the $549 headset&lt;/a&gt;, of course. Pillonel also considered adding support for USB-C audio but dropped that idea after finding that you’d need an extra chip to make it happen, which would make the mod more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="joiiOi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qnw56zHnydE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kcKPbU"&gt;Pillonel has been behind numerous USB-C mods we’ve seen over the past few years for Apple products, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759704/usb-c-iphone-hack-mod-open-source-github-repo-ken-pillonel-design-video"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/20/23271164/airpods-usb-c-iphone-modder-ken-pillonel"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23590668/airpods-pro-usb-c-mod-engineering-open-source-pcb"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhzE2R"&gt;Since then, Apple has added USB-C to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23859779/iphone-15-plus-usb-c-price-release-date-apple"&gt;iPhone 15&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review"&gt;second-gen AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, so he may not have many options left unless he wants to give the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057392/apple-vision-pro-battery-lightning-cable"&gt;Vision Pro’s battery cable&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LLsbYC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The AirPods Max are getting left behind, so are new Apple headphones coming this year?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23755432/airpods-max-no-adaptive-audio-conversation-volume-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4DwAv3"&gt;Last year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/25/23931989/apple-airpods-4-max-pro-rumor-new-features"&gt;reported that Apple is preparing&lt;/a&gt; to launch a new version of its AirPods Max with USB-C and new color options sometime this year. Although the rumors don’t detail other major technical changes to the AirPods Max aside from an upgraded H2 chip, the headphones will hopefully come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440788/apple-airpods-max-lossless-music-explainer-spatial-audio"&gt;support for lossless audio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos’ first headphones now rumored to launch in June for $449</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q6yPjN"&gt;Sonos plans to release its first pair of wireless headphones in June after dealing with some late-stage software setbacks, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/sonos-headphones-delayed-until-june-party-speaker-and-tv-box-also-in-the-works"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The headphones will tie into the company’s ecosystem of speakers and home theater soundbars and are expected to be priced at $449, putting them firmly in the premium market of mainstream consumer headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHirjP"&gt;There’s a lot riding on these upcoming headphones for Sonos. CEO Patrick Spence has made it clear that the company has high hopes for its latest hardware category. “This is the beginning of a multi-year product cycle where we expect to reap the rewards of our R&amp;amp;D investments,” Spence said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/23962936/sonos-major-new-product-coming-2024-tease"&gt;on an earnings call in November&lt;/a&gt;. “This cycle begins with our entry into a new multi-billion dollar category in the second half of the [fiscal] year that will complement our current offerings, delight customers, and drive immediate revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="02N17l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:12264050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ME4lE8"&gt;The road to the headphones launch has been a long one; Spence reportedly decided to temporarily shelve the project in 2020, delaying an initial plan to come to market in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmLd8d"&gt;Sonos “aims to produce between 650,000 and 1 million units over the next year to fulfill demand” for the headphones, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, signaling that it has confidence in the product, which will stream music over Wi-Fi for richer audio fidelity when used in the home. You’ll also be able to listen to content from any TV that’s hooked up to a Sonos-branded soundbar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZK1y8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report also reveals that Sonos is developing a large party speaker to directly challenge JBL, LG, Sony, and other players in that space. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23877274/sonos-move-2-review"&gt;Move 2&lt;/a&gt; is plenty loud as it is, so I can only imagine what an oversized Sonos speaker would be capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8a5DSf"&gt;With a release planned for early June — Sonos had originally targeted May, per the report — it won’t be long before we learn how Sonos plans to stand out from the headphone crowd. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says the company is already eyeing a second-gen model and potentially its own wireless earbuds, since those could have their own unique appeal for consumers who prefer an in-ear approach.&lt;/p&gt;
