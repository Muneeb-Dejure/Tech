ByteDance, the Chinese tech conglomerate that owns TikTok, thinks so. And some of its ex-employees are pissed.\n\nAs you may have read by now, ByteDance earlier this week notified its thousands of employees in the US that, for the first time, they can begin the process of selling their stock back to the company. Given that ByteDance has no near-term plans to go public or spin off TikTok as a standalone entity, this employee buyback is the only option most staffers have for cashing out their vested shares.\n\nThese buybacks are fairly common among late-stage, privately-held tech companies, and ByteDance has done them regularly outside of the US for years. But there’s a big wrinkle to how the buyback works in the US that many employees weren’t expecting when they received the details on Monday: if you no longer work for ByteDance, your stock is worth 20 percent less than if you’re a current employee. This has caught many US shareholders by surprise, with some questioning whether what ByteDance is doing is illegal. At least one former TikTok manager has already filed a complaint with the SEC.\n\nHere’s how the buyback works, according to the info packet sent to employees that I was shown by a source: ByteDance will buy up to 2,277,120 of its “Class A ordinary shares” that were vested as of September 15th. Current employees get to sell their vested stock for $160 per share before taxes, implying a company valuation of $223.5 billion (yes, ByteDance is huge — more on that in a moment). Former employees, meanwhile, get to sell for $128 per share.\n\nIt’s extremely unusual for a company in the US to say that the same class of shares is worth a different price depending on who the shareholder is. I checked with the folks at Levels.fyi, who said they “have not heard of a case like this previously.” Some ex-ByteDance employees I’ve spoken with this week are fuming.\n\nLeading the pack is Patrick Ryan, a lawyer who was TikTok’s lead technical program manager for security until the summer of 2022. He made headlines in 2020 for suing former President Donald Trump over his proposed TikTok ban. This time, he’s organizing a group of ex-employees to push back on ByteDance. \n\nHe has filed a complaint with the SEC about the different stock prices and how ByteDance has made it difficult to access the buyback program’s details. (You can’t download or forward the watermarked documents through ByteDance’s web portal, which makes it difficult to share the details with your lawyer, accountant, or financial advisor.) He’s also upset that ByteDance has blocked his request to sell his vested shares to another qualified buyer, Setter Capital, at a higher price point. \n\nEmployees are also frustrated that this buyback is being done at a discount to what ByteDance offered non-US workers last year, when the valuation was lowered after the markets dropped. “They mismanaged it,” a former senior manager told me.\n\nRyan has posted publicly about the buyback on social media — I recommend this thread on LinkedIn that includes comments from other ex-TikTok employees as well. He’s organizing a Discord group for other employees who are upset about the buyback, which he told me now numbers several dozen people. Some are afraid that the company will “take shares away if they do anything because apparently they’ve been told this at some point,” he says.\n\nHere’s what ByteDance’s communications department had to say when I asked about all this: “Our US buyback program offers a unique opportunity for employees of a private company. Our pricing philosophy prioritizes our current employees, which also applies to former employees who were terminated due to business reorganization reasons. \n\nParticipation in this program is not mandatory and participants can choose to sell their shares at a time and price that works for them.”\n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fGFlmF73jD9i9SGTuhEglM2h5l8=/0x0:2596x1504/2596x1504/filters:focal(1298x752:1299x753)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24983251/ByteDance_income_statement.png]\n\nAlong with details about the buyback, ByteDance shared its high-level financials with employees this week, part of which you can view in the above chart.\n\nTikTok’s owner, thanks largely to its ads business in China, is quite profitable. Last year, ByteDance’s operating profit was only about 30 percent less than Meta’s. Its available cash increased from $22.33 billion at the end of last year to $30.39 billion at the end of March 2023. TikTok’s fate in the US may still be uncertain, but one thing is for sure: there’s a firehose of money powering it.\n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6KHVZ7j34n4j5eR2hmhFqrFF52A=/0x0:501x500/501x500/filters:focal(251x250:252x251)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24706041/Command_Line_Linda_Yaccarino.jpeg]\n\nLinda, Paris, and Elon\n\nIt has been a busy week for Linda Yaccarino, who seems set on quickly moving past her disastrous Code Conference performance I covered last week. \n\nShe started this week by going back to the early 2000s and announcing a partnership between X and Paris Hilton, the “queen of pop culture, music, business, and TV.” After I covered the deal on The Verge, one of you pointed out that Yaccarino was recently named board chair for Hilton’s management company, YMU. That level of self-dealing is par for the course in Muskworld, of course, but it’s still pretty cringe.\n\nIt looks like whatever bespoke revenue sharing agreement X struck does not keep Hilton from posting on Threads, either. “In old times, we debated whether Paris had enough star power to even merit a visit to our blue room,” a former Twitter exec told me this week. “And now she’s the centerpiece. It’s sad.”\n\nYaccarino then traveled to Dallas, Texas, for ex-Snap business chief Imran Khan’s invite-only “Khanference,” where she spoke to a room full of money managers, product execs, and CEOs. People who attended told me that she came across as far more confident than she did at Code and that the X engagement numbers she shared sounded impressive.\n\nOn Thursday, she updated X’s lenders on the business plan, telling them that the company is cash-flow positive if you exclude its debt. (I liked Hunter Walk’s joke about this: “Not including the cost of my mortgage payments, my house is already cash flow positive.”) She confirmed that X is testing three subscription tiers, one of which would hide ads entirely. \n\nInside X, Yaccarino has yet to address the whole company, aside from a couple of emails that were copy-and-pastes of public posts about the business. A joint all-hands she was supposed to do with Musk several weeks ago never happened without explanation. If you’re an engineer or product person at X, you answer to Musk, who has over a dozen direct reports.\n\nAfter her Code performance, a former Tesla exec pinged me to say that “she demonstrates the same symptoms that I saw at Tesla. People so concerned with ‘how will Elon react to what I’m saying,’ or ‘what would Elon say’ that they’re unable to carry on basic conversations. \n\nHe’s unpredictable in his reactions because he’s mentally unstable… I don’t wish that on anyone.” \n\n---\n\nAI reporting notes\n\nWhat I’m paying attention to in the world of AI right now:\n\n* I’m hearing that Musk will likely raise a big round of funding for X.AI, his OpenAI competitor that he wants to be the antidote to what he thinks is “woke” AI. Some investors I’ve spoken to are wondering if he will try to fold X.AI into X / Twitter and use the AI efforts to lift X’s overall valuation, but that’s just speculation for now.\n* Snap and a handful of other companies are already testing Google’s next-generation, multimodal Gemini model, and it’s apparently very impressive.\n* It’s hard to overstate how much these large AI startup funding rounds are being driven by competition among the cloud providers. Take Anthropic’s recent deal with Amazon, which is a prelude to an even larger round the AI lab is trying to put together right now. A key deal term for Amazon, I’m told, was that Anthropic has to use AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips. It’s a huge blow to Google, Amazon’s competitor and Anthropic’s previous preferred cloud provider. Gergely Orosz reports in his excellent newsletter that “in mid-September, leadership instructed several teams in Google Cloud Services (GCP) to work seven days a week for up to one month” to “address performance issues on an NVIDIA H100 cluster which Anthropic, a major customer, depended on.” About a week later, the Amazon deal with Anthropic was announced.\n* A bunch of richly valued AI startups are quickly realizing they don’t have the distribution they need to compete. Character.AI, which lets people interact with a library of AI chatbot personas, is a good example of how the competitive landscape is changing very quickly. Mark Zuckerberg has entered the race with his own library of AI characters, which are being distributed for free through Meta’s apps that reach billions of people. Meta is willing to pay celebrities millions of dollars to use their likeness for its chatbots and has vastly more resources to achieve scale. It’s hard to see this not playing out similarly to how Zuckerberg copied Snapchat. Character, meanwhile, has about 3 million daily users and is in the early stages of raising hundreds of millions more dollars (mostly to fund its compute costs) at a valuation that could top $5 billion. \n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAIpKPxsU3gWo9sl5LKRYI9kny4=/0x0:501x501/501x501/filters:focal(251x251:252x252)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24698906/Command_Line_Tim_Sweeney.jpeg]\n\nBehind Epic’s layoffs\n\nThe timing of Epic’s Unreal Fest in New Orleans this year was a bit awkward, given the significant round of layoffs that Tim Sweeney just announced. Facing the company’s developer community earlier this week, he explained the rationale behind the cuts with refreshing bluntness for a CEO. \n\nAbout 10 weeks ago, Epic Games “realized we were running into a financial problem,” he said, and that the company needed to “stabilize our finances so that we won’t run out of money as we build the metaverse.” Management didn’t want to “spread the pain around equally,” so the cuts were targeted at areas that are less central to its core objectives. \n\nThe engineering team was only hit by about 3 percent, for example, while sales and marketing was hit by more than 30 percent. “It’s going to result in the degradation in quality of some of our work, and I’m sorry for that,” Sweeney told the room full of developers. \n\n“A funny thing about being funded so heavily by Fortnite over the past six years is that we’ve had different parts of our business get disconnected from their revenue streams,” he explained. “We have big teams serving different industry verticals without revenue to support it.” Starting next year, he said that non-gaming uses of the Unreal Engine will move to a “seat-based enterprise software licensing model,” with the goal of reviving revenue in that area of the business.\n\nThe elephant in the room while Sweeney talked was Roblox, of course. Roblox is far ahead of Epic’s creator efforts and arguably has a more expansive vision for what its platform can become. With only 2,800 employees versus Epic’s roughly 4,000, Roblox also has a more disciplined cost structure. Sweeney’s work is cut out for him.\n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAuRXtNv0q9xI2R0UxaB2i8EMoo=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24763503/Satya_Nadella_Command_Line.jpg]\n\nQuote of the week\n\n“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, and you search on Google.” - Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in court during the Google antitrust trial. \n\nThis case continues to provide fascinating insight into how Google works and its unrivaled influence over the web. Eddy Cue’s testimony about Apple’s view of the search deal wasn’t as exciting as I’d hoped. Nadella, however, was fiery on the stand. He revealed how Microsoft was willing to lose money to make Bing the default search engine on the iPhone, but it couldn’t overcome Apple’s lucrative deal with Google. \n\nIt’s good that Google doesn’t get to hide the Justice Department’s trial exhibits from the public. One of my favorites is an internal communications training doc by VP of finance Michael Roszak that says only “cigarettes or drugs” could rival the economics of search advertising.\n\n---\n\nThe watercooler\n\nA roundup of what else happened in the tech industry this week that you may have missed:\n\n* Microsoft is aiming to close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard next week.\n* Meta laid off a significant chunk of its in-house silicon team. (For Meta, it makes sense to just hitch your wagon to Qualcomm at this point.)\n* Amazon is internally testing its AI-powered “conversational shopping agent,” codenamed Project Nile, with the hope of a public launch early next year.\n* Tim Cook sold a chunk of Apple stock worth about $41 million after taxes — his biggest sale in over two years.\n* Google co-founder Sergey Brin made a brief appearance at a recent employee all-hands to say how excited he is about AI. (His comments sound like what he recently told an AI hacker house.)\n* Slack is pausing normal operations internally next week to make employees meet their usage goal for Salesforce’s Trailhead learning course. \n* Anduril, Palmer Luckey’s defense tech startup, is looking to raise a big round of funding at a roughly $10 billion valuation.\n* Yuga Labs announced an unspecified number of layoffs.\n\n---\n\nPeople moves\n\nSome interesting career moves I noticed this week:\n\n* Jeremi Gorman, Netflix’s head of ads sales, is leaving after barely a year and being replaced by company vet Amy Reinhard. Eunice Kim is being promoted to Netflix CPO, and the streamer’s head of data, Elizabeth Stone, is being promoted to CTO amid an exec team shakeup.\n* Luther Lowe, Yelp’s former head of policy, has joined Y Combinator in a new role: head of public policy.\n* Aparna Chennapragada, the former CPO of Robinhood, has joined Microsoft as VP of generative AI products.\n* Cheryan Jacob, Flexport’s top engineering exec, and Chris Ferro, the chief legal officer, have been pushed out. (The situation sounds pretty dramatic over there with mass layoffs on the way.) \n* Gil Golan, the CTO of GM, is out after just a month on the job.\n* Campbell Brown, Meta’s VP of media partnerships, is leaving. She’ll stay on as a consultant. It’s a move that cements the company’s messy divorce from the news industry.\n* Stephanie Latham, a former Meta VP of ad partnerships, has joined Roblox to lead partnerships and report to Christina Wootton.\n* Caroline Nolan, a former exec comms VP at Meta, joined Pinterest as VP of communications. \n* Nicolas Cabrera, the former CPO of Bakkt, has joined Lightspark as VP of product.\n* Oana Ruxandra, the chief digital officer for Warner Music, is leaving after she lost the CEO role to Robert Kyncl.\n\n---\n\nInteresting links\n\n* The Browser Company made a fun and unique product launch video.\n* My colleague Elizabeth Lopatto’s report from inside the courtroom during the beginning of Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial.\n* Eric Kress on “why Unity had to screw everyone.”\n* Medium CEO Tony Stubblebine is ready to go to war against the LLMs.\n* The fediverse is tiny: Mastodon received €326,000 in donations last year and reported operating expenses of €127,000.\n* The story behind Patreon’s big redesign.\n* Even Fred Wilson can have his NFTs stolen.\n* How Silicon Valley fell in love with Loro Piana.\n\n---\n\nThat’s it for this week. I’d love to hear your feedback, story ideas, and tips.\n\nThanks for subscribing.\n"}</script><link rel="preload" as="image"

Given that ByteDance has no near-term plans to go public or spin off TikTok as a standalone entity, this employee buyback is the only option most staffers have for cashing out their vested shares.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">These buybacks are fairly common among late-stage, privately-held tech companies, and ByteDance has done them regularly outside of the US for years. But there’s a big wrinkle to how the buyback works in the US that many employees weren’t expecting when they received the details on Monday: if you no longer work for ByteDance, your stock is worth <em>20 percent less</em> than if you’re a current employee. This has caught many US shareholders by surprise, with some questioning whether what ByteDance is doing is illegal. At least one former TikTok manager has already filed a complaint with the SEC.</p></div></div><div style="position:fixed;top:1px;left:1px;width:1px;height:0;padding:0;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border-width:0;display:none"></div><div class="relative z-[2] ml-[-20px] w-[100vw] md:left-[calc(-50vw+42%)] md:ml-0 lg:left-[calc(-50vw+75%)]"><div class="absolute top-[-200px] h-[200px] w-[100%] bg-paywall-fade"></div><div class="bg-white p-18"><div class="mx-auto my-20 border-t-2 border-t-blurple pt-18 lg:max-w-[1100px]"><h3 class="mb-14 font-polysans text-35 font-bold leading-100">Start your Command Line free trial now to continue reading</h3><p class="mb-18 font-fkroman text-18">This story is exclusively for subscribers of <em>Command Line</em>, our newsletter about the tech industry’s inside conversation.

ByteDance, the Chinese tech conglomerate that owns TikTok, thinks so. And some of its ex-employees are pissed.\n\nAs you may have read by now, ByteDance earlier this week notified its thousands of employees in the US that, for the first time, they can begin the process of selling their stock back to the company. Given that ByteDance has no near-term plans to go public or spin off TikTok as a standalone entity, this employee buyback is the only option most staffers have for cashing out their vested shares.\n\nThese buybacks are fairly common among late-stage, privately-held tech companies, and ByteDance has done them regularly outside of the US for years. But there’s a big wrinkle to how the buyback works in the US that many employees weren’t expecting when they received the details on Monday: if you no longer work for ByteDance, your stock is worth 20 percent less than if you’re a current employee. This has caught many US shareholders by surprise, with some questioning whether what ByteDance is doing is illegal. At least one former TikTok manager has already filed a complaint with the SEC.\n\nHere’s how the buyback works, according to the info packet sent to employees that I was shown by a source: ByteDance will buy up to 2,277,120 of its “Class A ordinary shares” that were vested as of September 15th. Current employees get to sell their vested stock for $160 per share before taxes, implying a company valuation of $223.5 billion (yes, ByteDance is huge — more on that in a moment). Former employees, meanwhile, get to sell for $128 per share.\n\nIt’s extremely unusual for a company in the US to say that the same class of shares is worth a different price depending on who the shareholder is. I checked with the folks at Levels.fyi, who said they “have not heard of a case like this previously.” Some ex-ByteDance employees I’ve spoken with this week are fuming.\n\nLeading the pack is Patrick Ryan, a lawyer who was TikTok’s lead technical program manager for security until the summer of 2022. He made headlines in 2020 for suing former President Donald Trump over his proposed TikTok ban. This time, he’s organizing a group of ex-employees to push back on ByteDance. \n\nHe has filed a complaint with the SEC about the different stock prices and how ByteDance has made it difficult to access the buyback program’s details. (You can’t download or forward the watermarked documents through ByteDance’s web portal, which makes it difficult to share the details with your lawyer, accountant, or financial advisor.) He’s also upset that ByteDance has blocked his request to sell his vested shares to another qualified buyer, Setter Capital, at a higher price point. \n\nEmployees are also frustrated that this buyback is being done at a discount to what ByteDance offered non-US workers last year, when the valuation was lowered after the markets dropped. “They mismanaged it,” a former senior manager told me.\n\nRyan has posted publicly about the buyback on social media — I recommend this thread on LinkedIn that includes comments from other ex-TikTok employees as well. He’s organizing a Discord group for other employees who are upset about the buyback, which he told me now numbers several dozen people. Some are afraid that the company will “take shares away if they do anything because apparently they’ve been told this at some point,” he says.\n\nHere’s what ByteDance’s communications department had to say when I asked about all this: “Our US buyback program offers a unique opportunity for employees of a private company. Our pricing philosophy prioritizes our current employees, which also applies to former employees who were terminated due to business reorganization reasons. \n\nParticipation in this program is not mandatory and participants can choose to sell their shares at a time and price that works for them.”\n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fGFlmF73jD9i9SGTuhEglM2h5l8=/0x0:2596x1504/2596x1504/filters:focal(1298x752:1299x753)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24983251/ByteDance_income_statement.png]\n\nAlong with details about the buyback, ByteDance shared its high-level financials with employees this week, part of which you can view in the above chart.\n\nTikTok’s owner, thanks largely to its ads business in China, is quite profitable. Last year, ByteDance’s operating profit was only about 30 percent less than Meta’s. Its available cash increased from $22.33 billion at the end of last year to $30.39 billion at the end of March 2023. TikTok’s fate in the US may still be uncertain, but one thing is for sure: there’s a firehose of money powering it.\n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6KHVZ7j34n4j5eR2hmhFqrFF52A=/0x0:501x500/501x500/filters:focal(251x250:252x251)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24706041/Command_Line_Linda_Yaccarino.jpeg]\n\nLinda, Paris, and Elon\n\nIt has been a busy week for Linda Yaccarino, who seems set on quickly moving past her disastrous Code Conference performance I covered last week. \n\nShe started this week by going back to the early 2000s and announcing a partnership between X and Paris Hilton, the “queen of pop culture, music, business, and TV.” After I covered the deal on The Verge, one of you pointed out that Yaccarino was recently named board chair for Hilton’s management company, YMU. That level of self-dealing is par for the course in Muskworld, of course, but it’s still pretty cringe.\n\nIt looks like whatever bespoke revenue sharing agreement X struck does not keep Hilton from posting on Threads, either. “In old times, we debated whether Paris had enough star power to even merit a visit to our blue room,” a former Twitter exec told me this week. “And now she’s the centerpiece. It’s sad.”\n\nYaccarino then traveled to Dallas, Texas, for ex-Snap business chief Imran Khan’s invite-only “Khanference,” where she spoke to a room full of money managers, product execs, and CEOs. People who attended told me that she came across as far more confident than she did at Code and that the X engagement numbers she shared sounded impressive.\n\nOn Thursday, she updated X’s lenders on the business plan, telling them that the company is cash-flow positive if you exclude its debt. (I liked Hunter Walk’s joke about this: “Not including the cost of my mortgage payments, my house is already cash flow positive.”) She confirmed that X is testing three subscription tiers, one of which would hide ads entirely. \n\nInside X, Yaccarino has yet to address the whole company, aside from a couple of emails that were copy-and-pastes of public posts about the business. A joint all-hands she was supposed to do with Musk several weeks ago never happened without explanation. If you’re an engineer or product person at X, you answer to Musk, who has over a dozen direct reports.\n\nAfter her Code performance, a former Tesla exec pinged me to say that “she demonstrates the same symptoms that I saw at Tesla. People so concerned with ‘how will Elon react to what I’m saying,’ or ‘what would Elon say’ that they’re unable to carry on basic conversations. \n\nHe’s unpredictable in his reactions because he’s mentally unstable… I don’t wish that on anyone.” \n\n---\n\nAI reporting notes\n\nWhat I’m paying attention to in the world of AI right now:\n\n* I’m hearing that Musk will likely raise a big round of funding for X.AI, his OpenAI competitor that he wants to be the antidote to what he thinks is “woke” AI. Some investors I’ve spoken to are wondering if he will try to fold X.AI into X / Twitter and use the AI efforts to lift X’s overall valuation, but that’s just speculation for now.\n* Snap and a handful of other companies are already testing Google’s next-generation, multimodal Gemini model, and it’s apparently very impressive.\n* It’s hard to overstate how much these large AI startup funding rounds are being driven by competition among the cloud providers. Take Anthropic’s recent deal with Amazon, which is a prelude to an even larger round the AI lab is trying to put together right now. A key deal term for Amazon, I’m told, was that Anthropic has to use AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips. It’s a huge blow to Google, Amazon’s competitor and Anthropic’s previous preferred cloud provider. Gergely Orosz reports in his excellent newsletter that “in mid-September, leadership instructed several teams in Google Cloud Services (GCP) to work seven days a week for up to one month” to “address performance issues on an NVIDIA H100 cluster which Anthropic, a major customer, depended on.” About a week later, the Amazon deal with Anthropic was announced.\n* A bunch of richly valued AI startups are quickly realizing they don’t have the distribution they need to compete. Character.AI, which lets people interact with a library of AI chatbot personas, is a good example of how the competitive landscape is changing very quickly. Mark Zuckerberg has entered the race with his own library of AI characters, which are being distributed for free through Meta’s apps that reach billions of people. Meta is willing to pay celebrities millions of dollars to use their likeness for its chatbots and has vastly more resources to achieve scale. It’s hard to see this not playing out similarly to how Zuckerberg copied Snapchat. Character, meanwhile, has about 3 million daily users and is in the early stages of raising hundreds of millions more dollars (mostly to fund its compute costs) at a valuation that could top $5 billion. \n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAIpKPxsU3gWo9sl5LKRYI9kny4=/0x0:501x501/501x501/filters:focal(251x251:252x252)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24698906/Command_Line_Tim_Sweeney.jpeg]\n\nBehind Epic’s layoffs\n\nThe timing of Epic’s Unreal Fest in New Orleans this year was a bit awkward, given the significant round of layoffs that Tim Sweeney just announced. Facing the company’s developer community earlier this week, he explained the rationale behind the cuts with refreshing bluntness for a CEO. \n\nAbout 10 weeks ago, Epic Games “realized we were running into a financial problem,” he said, and that the company needed to “stabilize our finances so that we won’t run out of money as we build the metaverse.” Management didn’t want to “spread the pain around equally,” so the cuts were targeted at areas that are less central to its core objectives. \n\nThe engineering team was only hit by about 3 percent, for example, while sales and marketing was hit by more than 30 percent. “It’s going to result in the degradation in quality of some of our work, and I’m sorry for that,” Sweeney told the room full of developers. \n\n“A funny thing about being funded so heavily by Fortnite over the past six years is that we’ve had different parts of our business get disconnected from their revenue streams,” he explained. “We have big teams serving different industry verticals without revenue to support it.” Starting next year, he said that non-gaming uses of the Unreal Engine will move to a “seat-based enterprise software licensing model,” with the goal of reviving revenue in that area of the business.\n\nThe elephant in the room while Sweeney talked was Roblox, of course. Roblox is far ahead of Epic’s creator efforts and arguably has a more expansive vision for what its platform can become. With only 2,800 employees versus Epic’s roughly 4,000, Roblox also has a more disciplined cost structure. Sweeney’s work is cut out for him.\n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAuRXtNv0q9xI2R0UxaB2i8EMoo=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24763503/Satya_Nadella_Command_Line.jpg]\n\nQuote of the week\n\n“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, and you search on Google.” - Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in court during the Google antitrust trial. \n\nThis case continues to provide fascinating insight into how Google works and its unrivaled influence over the web. Eddy Cue’s testimony about Apple’s view of the search deal wasn’t as exciting as I’d hoped. Nadella, however, was fiery on the stand. He revealed how Microsoft was willing to lose money to make Bing the default search engine on the iPhone, but it couldn’t overcome Apple’s lucrative deal with Google. \n\nIt’s good that Google doesn’t get to hide the Justice Department’s trial exhibits from the public. One of my favorites is an internal communications training doc by VP of finance Michael Roszak that says only “cigarettes or drugs” could rival the economics of search advertising.\n\n---\n\nThe watercooler\n\nA roundup of what else happened in the tech industry this week that you may have missed:\n\n* Microsoft is aiming to close its acquisition of Activision Blizzard next week.\n* Meta laid off a significant chunk of its in-house silicon team.

ByteDance, the Chinese tech conglomerate that owns TikTok, thinks so. And some of its ex-employees are pissed.\n\nAs you may have read by now, ByteDance earlier this week notified its thousands of employees in the US that, for the first time, they can begin the process of selling their stock back to the company. Given that ByteDance has no near-term plans to go public or spin off TikTok as a standalone entity, this employee buyback is the only option most staffers have for cashing out their vested shares.\n\nThese buybacks are fairly common among late-stage, privately-held tech companies, and ByteDance has done them regularly outside of the US for years. But there’s a big wrinkle to how the buyback works in the US that many employees weren’t expecting when they received the details on Monday: if you no longer work for ByteDance, your stock is worth 20 percent less than if you’re a current employee. This has caught many US shareholders by surprise, with some questioning whether what ByteDance is doing is illegal. At least one former TikTok manager has already filed a complaint with the SEC.\n\nHere’s how the buyback works, according to the info packet sent to employees that I was shown by a source: ByteDance will buy up to 2,277,120 of its “Class A ordinary shares” that were vested as of September 15th. Current employees get to sell their vested stock for $160 per share before taxes, implying a company valuation of $223.5 billion (yes, ByteDance is huge — more on that in a moment). Former employees, meanwhile, get to sell for $128 per share.\n\nIt’s extremely unusual for a company in the US to say that the same class of shares is worth a different price depending on who the shareholder is. I checked with the folks at Levels.fyi, who said they “have not heard of a case like this previously.” Some ex-ByteDance employees I’ve spoken with this week are fuming.\n\nLeading the pack is Patrick Ryan, a lawyer who was TikTok’s lead technical program manager for security until the summer of 2022. He made headlines in 2020 for suing former President Donald Trump over his proposed TikTok ban. This time, he’s organizing a group of ex-employees to push back on ByteDance. \n\nHe has filed a complaint with the SEC about the different stock prices and how ByteDance has made it difficult to access the buyback program’s details. (You can’t download or forward the watermarked documents through ByteDance’s web portal, which makes it difficult to share the details with your lawyer, accountant, or financial advisor.) He’s also upset that ByteDance has blocked his request to sell his vested shares to another qualified buyer, Setter Capital, at a higher price point. \n\nEmployees are also frustrated that this buyback is being done at a discount to what ByteDance offered non-US workers last year, when the valuation was lowered after the markets dropped. “They mismanaged it,” a former senior manager told me.\n\nRyan has posted publicly about the buyback on social media — I recommend this thread on LinkedIn that includes comments from other ex-TikTok employees as well. He’s organizing a Discord group for other employees who are upset about the buyback, which he told me now numbers several dozen people. Some are afraid that the company will “take shares away if they do anything because apparently they’ve been told this at some point,” he says.\n\nHere’s what ByteDance’s communications department had to say when I asked about all this: “Our US buyback program offers a unique opportunity for employees of a private company.
