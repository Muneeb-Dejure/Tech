In <a href="https://x.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1725198557936852994?s=20">a statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, TikTok says it’s “proactively and aggressively removing this content and investigating how it got onto our platform.”</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph my-12 font-fkroman text-17 leading-150 text-gray-13 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Dozens of videos about the manifesto, titled “Letter to America,” have surfaced on TikTok over the past several days, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/16/tech/tiktok-osama-bin-laden-letter-to-america/index.html">with CNN reporting</a> the topic amassed “at least” 14 million views by Thursday. Originally published in 2002, the manifesto criticizes the US government’s presence in the Middle East and support of Israel. However, some creators are now trying to apply that criticism to the US government’s response to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.</p></div><span class="mb-8 font-polysans text-15 font-medium leading-150

Jeff Jackson, a freshman Democratic congressman from North Carolina, had more than 2.5 million followers on TikTok. Jackson’s follower count dropped by over 100,000 virtually overnight — as did his esteem among some of TikTok’s young users — after he voted to ban the app. \n\nThe bill passed with 352 votes, but to the legions of TikTokers who called their representatives to urge them not to ban the app, Jackson’s vote feels like a unique betrayal.\n\n[Media: https://www.tiktok.com/@noahglenncarter/video/7346291613947186475]\n\nOn Wednesday, Jackson posted a video on X laying out the rationale for his vote. “I don’t think TikTok is going to be banned,” he began. If the bill passes in the Senate, Jackson said in the video, he thinks the likeliest scenario is that “TikTok will be sold for billions of dollars and will continue to operate.” His opposition, he continued, is not with TikTok itself but with China’s national security laws and the sway the Chinese government has over TikTok’s algorithms — and, potentially, over American politics. “We got a big example of how that power could be used last week, and it wasn’t subtle,” Jackson said, referring to the pop-up notification TikTok served users that warned Congress is “planning a total ban of TikTok.” \n\nJackson also acknowledged TikTok users’ concern that Congress is attempting to pass legislation that could potentially ban an app they don’t even understand. “I know a lot of you have seen some members of Congress be deeply uninformed about this because they don’t use TikTok and they don’t care,” he said. “But I do use it, and I think we can solve this problem and keep marching on.”\n\n[Media: https://twitter.com/JeffJacksonNC/status/1767936238625984739]\n\nTikTok users, meanwhile, weren’t happy with Jackson’s explanation. The comments section of his most recent video, posted on Monday, is full of people calling him a hypocrite. Some of the comments suggest that Jackson originally cross-posted his post-vote explanation video on TikTok, and then deleted it after a wave of backlash. \n\n“WITHOUT TIKTOK YOUR NOTHING!!! @Jeff Jackson,” said one irate viewer. “SELLLOUUUUTTTTTTTTTTT,” said another. Jackson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJackson grew his following on TikTok by posting explainers on everything from the Russia-Ukraine war to the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. \n\nIn interviews with Roll Call and The Washington Post, he’s touted TikTok as a way of educating constituents about the ins and outs of the legislative process. The app, he’s said, is good for transparency. Since the White House has forbidden federal employees, including members of Congress, from having TikTok on their government-issued phones, Jackson has the app installed on a separate personal device.\n\nLast April, Jackson told The Washington Post he’d vote for legislation banning TikTok “as a last resort,” though he’d prefer that ByteDance sell the app so he — and his constituents — can keep using it.\n\nFor now, Jackson can still post, although his posts are being brigaded with comments like “🍅 🍅 🍅 🍅 🍅 🍅 🍅 🍅 🍅.” And despite his recent drop in followers, he remains the most-followed member of Congress on TikTok.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Steven Mnuchin is working to create a buyer for TikTok.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-03-14T13:29:49.335Z","dateModified":"2024-03-14T13:29:49.335Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/14/24100634/steven-mnuchin-is-working-to-create-a-buyer-for-tiktok","author":[],"articleBody":"The former Treasury Secretary said on CNBC Thursday that he’s “going to put together a group to buy TikTok.” Such a group would need to have massive buying power, since the app boasts 170 million US users, and has an estimated value in the tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe House passed a bill Wednesday that could force TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance to sell it, or be banned from the US.\n\n[Attachment: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/14/former-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-is-putting-together-an-investor-group-to-buy-tiktok.html]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"TikTok CEO tells users to “make their voices heard” against a bill that could ban the app in the US.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-03-13T23:40:33.284Z","dateModified":"2024-03-13T23:40:33.284Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24100175/tiktok-ceo-tells-users-to-make-their-voices-heard-against-a-bill-that-could-ban-the-app-in-the-us","author":[],"articleBody":"Now that the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act has passed in the House of Representatives, TikTok CEO Shou Chew made — what else — a short video appealing to the app’s users to speak up against a ban.\n\nHe doesn’t address the possibility of a sale, saying the bill will take away their app if it becomes a law, but that “We believe we can overcome this together.”\n\n[Attachment: https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/7345981888646941994]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"If Congress wants to ban TikTok it should probably show us the evidence of Chinese interference.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-03-13T20:13:12.749Z","dateModified":"2024-03-13T20:13:12.749Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24099959/if-congress-wants-to-ban-tiktok-it-should-probably-show-us-the-evidence-of-chinese-interference","author":[],"articleBody":"We’ve heard so much about the dangers of TikTok from both sides of the aisle, and even had Trump flip-flop his position ostensibly over the political calculations of banning an app 170 million Americans use.

And even if one is introduced, Senate rules could make it tricky to maintain enough support (60 out of 100 members) to clear it. Just one senator can put a hold on legislation to keep it from advancing quickly. \n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has indicated he could be willing to do just that. He told The Washington Post prior to the House vote that he would block any bill he believed to violate the Constitution and said Congress shouldn’t “be trying to take away the First Amendment rights of [170] million Americans.”\n\nA long legal process could leave room for doubts — and lobbying money — to seep in. Consider the splashy introduction of the RESTRICT Act — another attempt to ban TikTok — in the Senate last year just before TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified in the House. Despite early excitement about the measure, it slowly fell off the radar as opponents lodged their critiques. Ultimately, it failed to move through the chamber. \n\n\"A long legal process could leave room for doubts — and lobbying money — to seep in\"\n\nNow, compare that to this past week, when TikTok reportedly scrambled to deal with the surprise bill, sending its users to flood House offices with calls that seemed to mostly just annoy staffers and leave some lawmakers with the impression that it was just another example of how TikTok can wield its influence machine.\n\nEven opposition from former President Donald Trump seemingly did not dissuade Republicans in the House from voting for the measure. It passed with 352 members supporting it and only 65 opposing, with one voting present.\n\nBut the Senate could be a different story. \n\nThere are already signs that Trump’s comments — that a TikTok ban would only help Meta — may be impacting some Republican senators. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Meet the Press that he was “conflicted” and doesn’t know yet how he would vote on a similar measure in the Senate. Graham did previously support the RESTRICT Act, which sought a different legal avenue that could also result in a TikTok ban.\n\nBut Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) maintained his longtime support for taking action on TikTok’s China ties, saying on X after the House vote that “the Senate should take up this bill immediately.”\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee chair and vice chair Mark Warner (D-VA) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) said in a joint statement that they were “encouraged by today’s strong bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives, and look forward to working together to get this bill passed through the Senate and signed into law.”\n\nIt’s significant that Warner is willing to get behind the House bill, given that he was the lead sponsor of the RESTRICT Act. Warner’s support for the new House legislation shows he’s willing to pursue other paths to deal with the threats he perceives from TikTok’s ownership.\n\n[Media: https://www.instagram.com/p/C4dwv3ivmMm/?hl=en]\n\nOther Democrats seem more wary.\n\n“We don’t have only a TikTok problem—we have a Big Tech privacy problem,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) wrote on X on Wednesday, advocating for his own online privacy legislation for children. “From Meta to Amazon to Discord, US-owned companies are preying on children \u0026 teens for profit. We don’t need to ban TikTok to fix their invasive practices. Passing my COPPA 2.0 is the answer.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has so far been noncommittal about the path the bill could take. Schumer said simply in a statement after the House passed the bill that “The Senate will review the legislation when it comes over from the House.”\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"I’ll have what she’s having!","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-03-13T15:31:13.633Z","dateModified":"2024-03-13T15:31:13.633Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24099609/ill-have-what-shes-having","author":[],"articleBody":"“This is not an attempt to ban TikTok.

The bill passed with 352 votes, needing a two-thirds majority to advance. Sixty-five members voted against it, with one voting present.\n\nThe bill still needs to clear the Senate, which is no small task. But President Joe Biden said on Friday he would sign it into law if it passes.\n\nThe House vote revives some US policymakers’ hopes for a forced divestment of TikTok, due to fears that Chinese law could compel its parent company to hand over information on US users, presenting a national security risk. The House Energy and Commerce Committee last week voted 50–0 to advance the bill, after attending an intelligence briefing about the risks of foreign adversary-controlled apps. TikTok says it doesn’t store US user information in China and has been working on a plan to further protect such data, but that’s done little to quell lawmakers’ fears.\n\n\"Former President Trump is now arguing against a ban\"\n\nThe Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would penalize app stores and web hosting services if they host TikTok, provided it’s still owned by a Chinese company. The legislation names ByteDance, but could also apply to other social media apps owned by companies based in a handful of foreign adversary countries.\n\nStanding in opposition to the legislation is a group that includes TikTok users themselves, who flooded congressional offices with phone calls ahead of a committee vote thanks to a prompt in the app; free speech organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union; and former President Donald Trump, who posted on Truth Social that getting rid of TikTok would just stand to benefit Meta.\n\nThe ACLU argues the bill would effectively suppress speech, even if it doesn’t explicitly regulate content. It pointed to a federal court’s ruling in Montana blocking the state’s attempted ban of TikTok to back up its claims that the new House bill is unconstitutional.\n\n[Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhkRvCSm4tk]\n\nAhead of the vote, lawmakers argued passionately on the House floor both for and against the legislation.\n\nSeveral supporters emphasized that the bill is not an all-out ban, but instead an incentive to force divestment so TikTok can separate its ties to China.\n\n“This is not an attempt to ban TikTok. It’s an attempt to make TikTok better. Tic-tac-toe. A winner. A winner,” as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) put it.\n\n\"“It takes no position at all on the content of speech, only foreign adversary control.”\"\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI), who chairs the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and introduced the legislation, emphasized that the bill could not be used against American social media companies or individual social media users. He added that “it takes no position at all on the content of speech, only foreign adversary control.”\n\nBut opponents of the bill on both sides of the aisle echoed each others’ concerns. Opponents fear the bill will be an ineffective solution to real national security concerns, while coming with unacceptable limits on free speech and expansion of governmental power.\n\n“It’s dangerous to give the president that kind of power, to give him the power to decide what Americans can see on their phones and on their computers,” said Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY).\n\n“I cannot sign a blank check to some future president who would easily and dangerously weaponize this legislation to profit in silence,” said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA). TikTok users who make their living on the app have complained that losing access to the app would plummet their incomes. “Creatives, artists, content creators, and businesses in my district will get caught in the crossfire of this bill and deserve better than federal overreach as a substitute for a thoughtful and incisive solution to this complicated national security challenge,” Kamlager-Dove added.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes criticized the process to advance the bill as “secret” and said the bill was being “jammed through” to enact a ban. “We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service,” Hughes said in a statement.\n\n\"Earlier efforts to ban TikTok fizzled out\"\n\nEfforts to ban TikTok heated up in March last year, when CEO Shou Zi Chew testified in the House for the first time, then slowed to an apparent standstill until recently. In 2023, a bipartisan group of senators introduced the RESTRICT Act, which put the power to ban apps that present national security risks in the hands of the secretary of commerce.\n\nAlthough Chew faced bipartisan grilling, some Democrats in particular expressed reservations about an all-out ban. And despite the early push from a group of powerful lawmakers, the RESTRICT Act ultimately fizzled out amid a strong lobbying campaign by TikTok and Republican concerns about granting too much executive branch power over the private sector.\n\nNow is a particularly tricky time to try to pass a TikTok ban, as candidates including Biden are using the app to get their messages out to young voters ahead of the 2024 US elections.\n\nBut both the Biden and Trump administrations have considered their own efforts to ban or force a sale of TikTok, despite Trump’s more recent remarks opposing such policies. Beginning in 2020, Trump issued executive orders that would effectively ban or force a sale of TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps. Those efforts faced legal roadblocks, and once Biden took office he revoked and replaced the orders with a new one, creating a framework to determine national security risks of such apps. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Donald Trump has even more to say about the TikTok ban.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-03-11T17:22:44.349Z","dateModified":"2024-03-11T17:22:44.349Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/11/24097416/donald-trump-has-even-more-to-say-about-the-tiktok-ban","author":[],"articleBody":"Appearing on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Trump explained, again, why he no longer supports the push to ban TikTok. “...without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people along with a lot of the media.”\n\nAnd as for his own unsuccessful push to ban the ByteDance-owned app, he now claims “I had it banned just about, I could have gotten it done.

The bill — called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act — is in response to the perceived national security risks of TikTok, particularly around how the company collects user data. The bill would require that TikTok break off from ByteDance or risk being removed from app stores in the US. \n\nThis isn’t the first bill of its kind; some members of Congress have been trying to ban the app for years. Some city and state governments have banned TikTok from being installed on government devices, and last year Montana became the first state to actually ban the app — though that ban was blocked by a judge and is currently making its way through the courts. If passed, the new bill — which the American Civil Liberties Union argues would violate the First Amendment — will likely face legal challenges as well.\n\nTikTok has previously appealed to its users as political pressure has mounted. In 2023, as support for a different bill was gaining steam, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared in a video posted to the official TikTok profile to warn users and ask them to essentially sound off in the comments.

The bill would be enforced by the US attorney general.\n\nIt also creates a process for the president to designate other social media companies from foreign adversary countries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as subject to the bill — meaning apps owned by designated companies that are distributed in the US would need to sever ties to continue operating there.\n\nIt’s the first big legislative push in Congress to act on national security concerns posed by TikTok’s ownership since the Senate introduced the RESTRICT Act last year. That bill came after the House Energy and Commerce Committee grilled TikTok’s CEO about its ties to China, which marked the peak of momentum on Capitol Hill around the idea of a TikTok ban or forced divestment.\n\nYet concerns over the RESTRICT Act’s reach and the authority it would grant to the executive branch eventually stalled movement on the issue.\n\nThe new legislation was crafted in an attempt to avoid potential constitutional concerns. For example, though it names ByteDance, it is tailored to avoid being seen as a penalty on an individual company. That’s in part because the bill allows for a 165-day period for ByteDance to avoid a ban on its apps if it divests them during that time; it also creates a process by which it could be applied to other apps. \n\nWhile TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, it has maintained that it keeps US user data on servers outside of the country and is working on plans to get US data even further out of reach from China-based ByteDance employees. Many lawmakers have expressed concern that China’s national security law could compel ByteDance to hand over information on US users if they have access to it.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Alex Haurek said in a statement that the bill “is an outright ban of TikTok, no matter how much the authors try to disguise it. This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs.”\n\nDespite bipartisan concern, it remains a major question if any action to divest or ban TikTok can reignite momentum during an election year — especially one where TikTok is a useful tool for candidates hoping to secure their seats. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Meta, TikTok CEOs confronted in Congress over their platforms’ harms","alternativeHeadline":"In the end, several advocates said that even a face-to-face apology from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg felt empty.","datePublished":"2024-02-01T16:26:45.681Z","dateModified":"2024-02-01T16:26:45.681Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24057460/senators-confront-meta-tiktok-snap-x-discord-ceos-kids-online-harm","author":[],"articleBody":"During an unusually emotional hearing on Wednesday, senators spent hours trying to get a group of five tech CEOs to confront the harms their platforms have caused and submit to more checks on their power.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee invited the CEOs of Meta, TikTok, Snap, X, and Discord to face the families of children who’d died following cyberbullying, sexual exploitation, or other harmful events on their platforms. They asked why Section 230, the law that shields online platforms from being held liable for their users’ posts, should stop these families from facing them in court.\n\nThe CEOs expressed condolences for the families hurt on their services but reiterated the work and investment they’ve already made to keep users safe. Advocates and lawmakers were left unimpressed by the CEOs’ remarks — but emboldened to push forward their proposals. “We can do this,” Senate Judiciary Ranking Member Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said to Chair Dick Durbin (D-IL) at a press conference after the hearing. “Working with you, I pledge my complete and total support to go to the floor of the United States Senate and ask for a reckoning.”\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), too, sounded optimistic after the hearing at a rally of supporters for the Kids Online Safety Act. The bill, which he leads with Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), would create a legal duty of care for large platforms to make their services safe for kids.\n\n“I can guarantee you, we will win this fight for the Kids Online Safety Act,” Blumenthal said, exuding the kind of confidence that’s a rarity in Washington, given the difficulty of passing legislation in a deeply divided Congress.\n\nA package of five kids online safety bills has already passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with unanimous votes, including the EARN IT Act, which seeks to weaken Section 230 protections, and the Cooper Davis Act, that would require platforms to report known illicit drug trafficking on their sites to the Drug Enforcement Administration. KOSA, which was introduced in another committee, already has the support of nearly half the Senate.\n\n[Image: Sen.

Graham called it “pitiful” and “borderline bullshit.” Even a direct apology from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seemed to fall flat. At the prompting of Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who asked if Zuckerberg had apologized to the families of social media victims, the CEO stood up and faced the back of the room, where several rows of parents sat with pictures of their kids.\n\n“I’m sorry for everything you have all been through,” Zuckerberg said. “No one should go through the things that your families have suffered and this is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry-leading efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.”\n\nThe apology rang hollow to several of those who’d attended. It “means nothing,” said Rose Bronstein, who carried a picture of her son Nate, who she said died by suicide as a teenager after being cyberbullied on Snapchat. “Empty, empty, empty.” \n\n[Image: Rose Bronstein holds a photo of her son, Nate, who she said died by suicide after being cyberbullied on Snapchat. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_MapQ8AQ_GIXUvuBbjg1pahBbUI=/0x0:4032x3024/4032x3024/filters:focal(2016x1512:2017x1513)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25260168/IMG_9018.jpg]\n\nMaurine Molak, whose son David died by suicide at age 16 after she said he’d been cyberbullied on Instagram, called Zuckerberg’s remarks a “basic apology.” While he was sorry for what the families went through, she said, “he didn’t take any responsibility for that. And it was shallow, in my opinion. And it was hurtful to me because what happened to David happened on his platform.”\n\n[Image: Maurine Molak holds a photo of her son David, who she said died by suicide after being cyberbullied on Instagram. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b4FBtJ3-_n2cCwB3CCiXEO6UFkU=/0x0:3024x4032/3024x4032/filters:focal(1512x2016:1513x2017)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25260171/IMG_9022.jpg]\n\nFormer Meta employee Arturo Bejar — who previously testified before a Senate subcommittee after blowing the whistle on what he felt were inadequate steps by the company to protect kids — said he was “glad” Zuckerberg apologized, “but that is by far not enough.” Instead, he said, Zuckerberg should speak with each of the parents present and understand what happened with their kids on the platforms. “Each of those things should be a project that makes things better,” Bejar said. “A company with 80,000 people can afford to do that. It’s a matter of prioritization.”\n\nOne thing tech companies could do to show their goodwill, suggested Zamaan Qureshi, co-chair of youth-led coalition Design It For Us, is to “get their trade organizations to back off” from lobbying against the bills. Of the witnesses, only Snap broke ranks before the hearing from peers and its own trade group NetChoice by endorsing KOSA. During the hearing, X CEO Linda Yaccarino also offered her support for the bill. Microsoft, which was not summoned to the hearing, endorsed KOSA the day before.\n\nLawmakers and advocates have consistently pointed to tech lobbying as a barrier to legislation making it to the president’s desk. But KOSA has also been opposed by a range of civil liberties organizations that warn it could lead to heightened surveillance and a crackdown on LGBTQ content online. The bill’s broad definition of harm to children has been hotly debated, as has its choice to allow state attorneys general to enforce the rule, particularly as many states are attempting a severe legal crackdown on transgender adults and children. Stricter age verification, a prerequisite for many reforms, would likely make the internet less private for everyone. And internet law experts have warned that weakening Section 230 would encourage tech platforms to either remove large amounts of legal content or take a hands-off approach that limits their liability.\n\nDigital advocacy group Fight for the Future, which opposes KOSA, critiqued the hearing for favoring “sound bites” over substantive issues like privacy and antitrust reform. “Hundreds of thousands of young people and others have spoken up, calling for legislation that protects privacy rather than leads to censorship,” said director Evan Greer in a statement. “But these bills’ sponsors have so far rejected common-sense fixes that would ensure these bills crack down on Big Tech’s harmful business practices rather than trampling free expression, privacy, and human rights.”\n\nBlumenthal told reporters on Tuesday he was still engaged in discussions about how to tweak KOSA, including on the state attorneys general provisions. Still, it’s clear many lawmakers on the committee feel that changing Section 230 is the most foundational step. “You will never get change until you open up the American courtroom,” Graham, who advocates ending Section 230, said at the press conference after the hearing. “Everybody holding up a photo, you should be allowed to go into court and make your case. When that day happens, they’ll come up here in earnest to talk with us about how to bring this to an end.”\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"TikTok’s CEO can’t catch a break from xenophobia in Congress","alternativeHeadline":"Congress held a hearing on child safety.

The Senate Judiciary Committee called up the CEOs of X, Meta, Snap, TikTok, and Discord and grilled them for four hours on the potential dangers their services posed for children. Many of the lawmakers emphasized emotional impact, playing to an audience filled with families who’d had kids targeted by predators or otherwise harmed online.\n\nBut midway through the hearing, it was dragged off course by a predictable tangent: the fact that TikTok is owned by Chinese company ByteDance. And a meeting ostensibly about keeping kids safe dipped into a now-familiar attempt to make TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew answer questions utterly unrelated to the rest of the day.\n\nAlthough attempts to ban TikTok last year mostly fizzled, there are real concerns about its data storage policies and Chinese government influence over its moderation. Some lawmakers touched on them, asking Chew to offer an update on Project Texas, its data security initiative. (TikTok is still working on it.) But the questions also strayed into attempts to simply highlight TikTok’s un-American origins, culminating in Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) pressing Chew aggressively and repetitively on his citizenship — which, it’s widely known, is Singaporean.\n\n“You often say that you live in Singapore,” Cotton said before demanding to know where Chew’s passport was from (Singapore, obviously) and whether he’d applied for citizenship in China or the US (no, said Chew). “Have you ever been a member of the Chinese Communist Party?” he then asked abruptly, as if hoping to catch Chew by surprise. Chew’s response wasn’t shocked so much as fed up. “Senator! I’m Singaporean!” he reiterated. “No.” (Singapore is not part of China.)\n\nThe Washington Post’s Drew Harwell described Cotton’s line of questioning as “McCarthy-esque.” Chew’s relationship to China was already discussed exhaustively when he appeared before Congress last year, and Cotton didn’t make clear what it had to do with child safety here. It’s not even necessary to make the case that China might have undue influence over TikTok. Apple, for instance, has weathered years of critiques about its relationship to the Chinese government; no reasonable person has ever suggested this hinges on Tim Cook being a secret communist. Instead, it’s a line of questioning that seems simply designed to play on Chew’s foreignness — even when it’s got nothing to do with the topic at hand.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Rep.

There’s been a lot of talk about tech regulation in the past few years, but almost nothing has actually passed, even though both sides love to hate on Big Tech. All that inaction means that Americans have basically given up regulatory control over tech to Europe, where the EU is passing more and more tech regulations by the day. \n\nSpeaking of which, the new iPhone has USB-C ports because of the EU. A bigger example is that EU competition law kept Adobe from buying Figma and is setting the tone for our own regulators. I wanted to know how Khanna felt about that, and if he could see a way forward for the US to retake a leadership role in thinking about tech.\n\nWe also talked about content moderation, which remains the most contentious issue in tech regulation. Almost every attempt to regulate content runs into the First Amendment, which it should. So the new trend is to come up with laws that are ostensibly to “protect the children,” regardless of those laws’ other consequences. I put that problem to Rep. Khanna and he has some thoughts here as well, and he returned to his call that Section 230 needs to be rethought.\n\nOf course, we also talked about the election. Khanna and I spoke the day after Trump walked away with the Republican Caucus in Iowa. But one key difference in this election cycle is the presence of generative AI, which can fire a cannon of just-believable-enough, highly targeted disinformation into every social network that exists. I wanted to know if there is any sort of plan for dealing with that, and on the flip side if there were any positive uses for generative AI in this election cycle.\n\nThat’s a lot, and to Khanna’s credit, he really went down the list with me. Also, I asked him to help me make a TikTok, so we really did hit all the boxes.\n\nOkay. Rep. Ro Khanna. Here we go.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. \n\nRo Khanna, you are the US representative for California’s 17th District. It has the most tech companies, I think, of any district in the country. Welcome to Decoder.\n\nThank you. Honored to be on.\n\nYeah, I’m very excited to talk to you. It is an election year. You’re among our first guests in what will be a challenging election year. We’re talking just after the Iowa caucuses where Trump ran away with a win. The House of Representatives, in particular, seems like it’s more chaotic than ever, maybe permanently in chaos. How are you thinking about 2024? There’s quite a lot happening. There’s a lot of actual lawmaking to talk about, but the context of all that seems quite challenging.\n\nWell, we’re going to be in a very difficult fight with Donald Trump. I mean, I think Iowa showed that basically he’s going to be the nominee. We shouldn’t underestimate him. There’s a lot of polling out there. But the number that concerns me the most is that we’re 20 to 25 points down on the economy. That means we need to do a far better job of communicating a forward-looking vision of how we’re going to improve people’s financial lives, how we’re going to bring economic security for them. Acknowledge that the American dream has slipped away for a lot of folks, that they’re drowning in college debt, they’re drowning in medical debt, housing is out of reach, can’t afford the rent, can’t afford to buy a new house, and the jobs that they may have aren’t paying enough. Then we need to offer two or three bold, concrete ideas on how we’re going to fix that moving forward.\n\nWhen you think about offering big, bold ideas… I want to talk about the economy. I want to talk about where the US is in terms of regulating tech companies compared to the European Union, which seems to be just forging ahead with new regulations every day. But bringing that home to regular people: On the scale of particular elections in the House, which are two-year cycles, how do you think about connecting “Okay, we got to make some big long-term bets and make some long-term policies to change how things are going, so people can feel it,” with also, “Every two years, I’m held accountable”? Because those things seem misaligned to me.\n\nWell, we’ve got staggered elections. So the presidency is every four years, and I agree that it still makes it hard. We’ve been suffering from short-termism in the United States. Our CEOs have to make quarterly earnings reports. Our politicians are perpetually running if you’re in the House of Representatives. And even presidents have four years, but basically they’ve got a year to do things and then the midterms come and then the presidential [election] comes. So I would just say, structurally, we’re aligned toward short-termism.\n\nOne of the most astute observations that someone made about President Biden is they said that President Biden is building cathedrals. We’re building new infrastructure. We’re building new clean energy opportunities and jobs. We’re building new semiconductor plants, but that these are often five, 10-year projects, but that voters vote on the here and now. What is happening to the cost of groceries? What is happening to my cost of rent? How is my household budget taking place? And so there are two challenges. One is how do we excite people about building cathedrals in communities and make that relevant to them where they feel ownership and excitement? And two, how do we deal with the here and now? And on both counts, we have to do better.\n\nGiven all of that, given the short-termism, given the fact that it’s just going to be a very noisy election cycle this year, should we expect Congress and Biden to get anything actually done this year? Or should we just put our expectations on hold?\n\nWell, the first rule for Congress should be do no harm. Can we actually get a budget deal so that you don’t have automatic cuts go into place? I mean, automatic 1 percent cuts at a time where we have an affordability crisis really would affect people. It would mean less assistance for housing, less assistance for food stamps. I do think we can get a budget deal. There have been some promising signs for at least getting a continuing resolution until March, which means we avoid a shutdown. [Rep. Mike] Johnson, to his credit, so far has been willing to stand up to the Freedom Caucus and say, “No, we’ve got to get some deal done.” I think that is the highest priority. Now, the second priority is can we get some aid, in my view, to Ukraine?\n\nBecause otherwise we’re going to basically be handing Donbas, Luhansk, and other parts of Ukraine to Putin. And that would be devastating after how hard the Ukrainians have fought. I’m hopeful we can do that, but that depends on the Republicans. And then the third thing is some immigration deal. And the Democrats are willing to do that. Having more border agents, having higher fines for people who are hiring unauthorized workers, having unauthorized workers have some process to get work. But we have to see if we can come to a compromise. So yes on getting a budget deal, most likely, but on the other things, harder.\n\nWell, let me just put that into context for this show. I agree those things are important. “Let’s not shut down the government” rises to there’s an emergency. “Let’s fund Ukraine” rises to a “there’s a war with the heart of Western democracy in peril and the state of Europe in peril” emergency. Immigration, constant low-boil emergency that both sides are kind of running on in different ways. Is that it? Things have to rise to that level of emergency status? Because I want to talk about AI, I want to talk about autonomous driving. I want to talk about how labor is going to change over the long term. And privacy regulation — we’ve been talking about it for 10 years, we haven’t gotten anywhere. Can that stuff ever break through in the system that we have today?\n\nYou know, look, I called for an internet bill of rights in 2017 with Tim Berners-Lee, and I’ve still been pushing it. The New York Times lets me write op-eds on AI and labor, but it’s hard to get legislation considered on that. And I’d say, one philosophical point, the problem with government is it seems the only time we’re capable of decisive action in the United States is in moments of crisis and emergency. So when covid happened, on a bipartisan basis, we passed the CARES Act. We put out enormous resources to save people from unemployment. We basically funded Operation Warp Speed with vaccines and distributed them. And I would give, actually, both on that — Trump and Biden — credit. And so you saw $5 trillion of massive resources mobilized, and the only nation that comes up with the best vaccines fast because of crisis. It may be overshot to some extent. I mean, that’s Larry Summers’ argument. \n\nBut the bottom line is that was government actually working and working in a moment of crisis. But then we seem incapable of long-term thinking to tackle immigration, education, industrialization, AI, technology regulation, privacy, things that aren’t immediate. And this, I would say, is the most legitimate criticism of the United States government. Now, I do think having a president lead on technology and say “This matters to me” would help, and I have great respect for President Biden, but this hasn’t been at the top. I mean, he’s had a lot on his plate, but it hasn’t been at the top of his concerns in the way it was, I would say, for President Obama, who was very conversant in technology. Would come out all the time to Stanford and knew the tech leaders, was willing to push back. So I do think having a president, having leadership, saying this really matters is important.\n\nYou’re describing a system that you have said a few times now is organized around short-termism, right? You’re making very short-term decisions. There’s a long-term view of things: building cathedrals, building infrastructure. You’ve got to run your office. This is the most Decoder question of all: How have you organized your office to balance the different needs and different constituents you have?\n\nWell, I’ve got a great team. So one, we empower people. We have a very decentralized approach to management. It’s not, “Okay, here’s what I’m saying needs to be done,” and then everyone follows it. There’s certain things they know are priorities of mine: building new clean steel plants, that bill. But what we do is empower people to say, what, given the values of this office, do you want to do? What are initiatives you want to run with, and how can you do that well? And how can we have flexibility in your life? So if you need to work remote at a certain point because you need to be with family, we understand that as long as you’re doing things.\n\nIf you want to be flexible in coming in some days, not coming in some days, we understand that. Here are times, though, that we all should get together for team meetings. And then you find a balance between our short-term goals, which is what do we have to do in this Congress to pass in this legislation and how do we have to respond to appropriations at committee hearings in the long-term projects that are important to you and our office? And I would say there’s one thing I’ve done slightly differently than most offices: really empower the young folks to be creative.\n\nAnd then here’s the Decoder question. Here’s the whole brand. You have a lot of decisions to make. You’re obviously a politician. You are trading votes back and forth, you’re making compromises. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework?\n\nThat’s a great question. So I make 70, 80 percent of decisions quite quickly because now I’ve been in Congress, it’s my eighth year. I have a clear set of guiding principles, a clear set of values. And we’ll probably hop on a text message often — maybe on Signal with my chief of staff, with my chief strategist, my comms director, and go back and forth. Sometimes a phone call, but often just back and forth texting, and we’ll be able to make a decision. Usually, if it’s anything of consequence, we’ll run it by a few people. And if it’s a real consequence, like what’s going on in the Middle East, I’ll talk to my wife. I’ll sometimes talk to my mother. I remember my mom calling me saying, “You need to call for a ceasefire. I don’t understand why you’re not calling for a ceasefire.”\n\nSo I did call for a ceasefire on November 21st. But for the broader, bigger decisions, I’ll probably not just talk to my team, but I’ll talk to my wife, talk to family members, people close to me, close friends. And then, in a day or two, couple days, ruminate, think, and make a decision.\n\nHow does the politics of it all factor into how you make decisions? I feel like I often talk to executives who are usually fully empowered to make decisions however they want. Maybe they have a board of directors, maybe they care about their institutional investors. Oftentimes, it feels like they’re just doing whatever they want. You have constituents. How does that affect how you make decisions?\n\nWell, it affects it a lot and it should affect it. I mean, they’re not electing Ro Khanna, philosopher king to go make decisions for them. They want to be heard. And so let’s talk about the situation in the Middle East. I had a town hall where I basically got yelled at for an hour and a half after October 7th. And it seemed in that town hall, I couldn’t say a single right word. And I heard very, very pointed criticism from folks on all sides of that issue. That did shape how I was looking at things. Now, I reached out to experts and reached out to ambassadors and foreign policy experts, but in the back of my mind were stories about Jewish Americans who knew people who had been captured and taken hostage. The brutality and fear that many people had in Israel and people in Gaza. I mean, folks in my district who knew people in Gaza who had literally been killed, children had been killed, multiple family members killed.\n\nSo I think the constituency on an issue like that did shape my sense of urgency, my sense of response. But ultimately, then you have to make a decision based on your values. And it’s a combination. And I think any politician who’s being honest will say that the politics of things does matter. Now, maybe not on matters as clearly on war and peace. I mean, they’re actually probably matters the least because most members of Congress feel the weight of those decisions. But on typical decisions, one will consider what is the impact of this? Is this going to upset certain groups? Is this going to make it harder on the president when we want the president to get reelected or is this a time to speak out? Of course, one considers that as one factor. It shouldn’t be the only factor or the dominant factor, but any politician has to consider it as a factor or you wouldn’t be effective.\n\nSo this brings me into kind of a big question, and then I do want to get into the policy of it all. Your district includes Apple’s headquarters, Intel, LinkedIn, Nvidia, Yahoo, which I imagine is just an enormous policy weight on your shoulders every single day. And the last time I asked you, “How do you think about representing these companies?” I remember very clearly you said, “Well, I’ve also got firefighters and teachers and cops, and I think about them more.” \n\nThat feels like it’s shifted, right? There’s something big since the last time we spoke to now, maybe in the last couple of years, where it feels like the tech giants are doing more politicking, they are more openly political, they’re pushing for different kinds of deregulatory structures. Do you feel that weight change at all over the past few years?\n\nThere’s certainly more tech wealth in the last few years. I mean Google, also. They’re technically in Mountain View, but most of their offices are in my district. And when you look at AI and the wealth that potentially could be generated, you’ve got Google, Anthropic, OpenAI in my district. A lot of Microsoft offices in my district. So many AI startups in my district. And you see more and more tech leaders taking an active role in policy conversations. Now, I still think that we have to prioritize the needs of working and middle-class families.\n\nAnd I’ll give you a concrete example. On the truck driving bill in California, many of the tech companies, they wanted it to be deregulated and let’s have automation do whatever it wanted to do. I sided with the teamsters, saying, “No, that we should have a human on board these trucks.” The reason being that for safety and that these workers actually know what will be safe. So I have this sense of both believing in technology’s promise and entrepreneurship’s promise and wanting to spread that opportunity in places across this country, but at the same time, pushing back on tech saying that you’ve got a blind spot when it comes to some of the issues for working and middle-class Americans. And we’ve got to do better in dealing with income inequality. I don’t always get that balance right, but I would say it’s more acute, the tension in my district.\n\nThat tension expressed, again, throughout the economy right now because of AI. The autonomous trucks bill is actually a really interesting example of it. And I kind of want you to walk me through a little bit. You wrote about it in The New York Times recently. The bill, as you said, would’ve required human drivers on board. The teamsters supported it. You supported, obviously, on the federal level. It passed the state assembly in California, and then Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed it. How did the dynamics of something like that work? That seemed like a very surprising result to me.\n\nWell, I was a little surprised he vetoed it because all the labor in California was for it. The teamsters had it as one of their highest priorities. Some of the business interests got to Gavin and said, “Well, this is going to lead to the offshoring of these companies to other states if not to other parts of the world.” And I disagree with that one. Silicon Valley, my district, is $10 trillion of market value. There’s a reason people still are starting companies there and innovating there. It’s because we’ve got Stanford and the world’s most brilliant technologists and extraordinary venture capital. So this idea that there’s some exodus from my district to talent or capital is just belied by the actual facts. I actually think AI is going to be a huge boom for Silicon Valley, but I think the bigger issue was do you trust working families and center and prioritize that?\n\nI don’t think the teamsters would want fake jobs. If those jobs really weren’t needed, they’d be the first to tell us. Working-class Americans have a lot of pride. They don’t want to just do things that don’t have dignity or value. And what they were saying is, “No, we need a human on board just like we need a pilot on board with all the recent airline issues. Certainly, we’re glad we have pilots and we have a crew on board.” And I think this gets to the crux of the issue. Sometimes the incentive is to use technology or AI to excessively automate. \n\nLet me give you a clear example. You call up an airline, and how many times do you have to press 0, 0, 0, 0, get me an agent, and you’re struggling. You’re almost sometimes fighting with the phone. And then sometimes the phone automatically disconnects you, and then you have to call back and figure out the code to get an agent. That’s excessive automation. A lot of times it would be better just to have the agent. Or how often have you tried to do some self-checkout at a grocery store or at a CVS, and you end up talking to the person running down because they have to take off the lock for the blades because the shaving blades have a lock on them. And this is stuff that an MBA may not figure out, but the workers would. And what I’m saying is we need to incentivize workers to think about how to use technology, not just to automate. And we need a tax code that doesn’t overly incentivize automation over investing in people.\n\nSo, in the case of truck drivers, right? It seems like self-driving will come to trucks in particular first, because they’re fixed routes traditionally on highways. You can apply a lot of regulation and surveillance to those things, because they’re commercial vehicles in different ways. There’s a big push in general to have AI do this to white collar industries. We’re going to replace a bunch of doctors and lawyers, right? AI can do a diagnosis pretty fast. Maybe it’s right, maybe it’s wrong, maybe it’s fully hallucinating, but it can do it. We’ve seen lawyers get in trouble for filing AI-written briefs. It’s coming to every sector of the economy, not just truck drivers. How are you thinking about a framework for understanding where it’s appropriate and where it’s not appropriate?\n\nWell, in one way, that is the interesting dynamic. Right now, you have truck drivers having solidarity this past summer with literally Hollywood writers. I mean, you couldn’t think of two more different jobs. And yet they’re both, in some ways, standing up to automation. Hollywood writers are saying, “Don’t have AI write all our scripts,” and the truck drivers are saying, “Let us have a job on these trucks.” And so, I actually think that there are interesting ways to have labor organized and have labor power and have labor solidarity, and that the growth of the labor movement in this country may be one of the most promising things to have countervailing power to corporations.\n\nAnd then you say, “Well, what does that mean concretely, Ro?” It means that when these companies are making decisions about how to use AI, workers should be at the table with a clear decision-making role, that there should be incentives for workers to get some sense of the company’s profits, which used to be the case with Sears Roebuck up until 1968. Workers used to get a percentage of the company’s profits. And so those kinds of things, I think, are more and more important as you have technology that could either be augmenting people or displacing people.\n\nWhen I think about the things LLMs can do today — the ChatGPTs of the world can do today, the Midjourneys of the world can do today — it’s create a lot of information. It’s pump out a lot of information very quickly. Maybe the information is right, maybe it’s wrong, maybe it’s totally made up. It feels like that will have a huge impact on the large platform companies which have to figure out how to moderate it. It will have a huge impact on our information environment, generally. Deepfakes are a real problem today. As we go into an election year, they’re going to be an even bigger and more dangerous problem. Do you have an idea in mind of how you might regulate away some of these openly negative effects of AI?\n\nThat is an enormous issue, and I think it starts with clean datasets. I mean, we’re putting garbage in, we’re going to get garbage out. And right now, a large part of the challenge with AI, it’s been trained with generative AI on everything on the internet without necessarily distinguishing what is true from false. And that is going to lead to distortive results. So I think we’ve got to figure out environments where there’s heavy disclosure on what data was put in, how it’s been used, and to encourage more clean datasets to be used.\n\nAnd then, I think, the challenge of deepfakes and the challenge of AI being able to create false content very fast and at scale is what’s concerning. And we need to have some sense of regulation around that, that there has to be clear labeling or marking of AI-generated products. This doesn’t mean that it’s all bad. I mean, there was someone in India actually using AI to have a politician speak in 20 different dialects. That could be a positive use of AI; Ro Khanna speaking in Spanish and speaking in Tagalog and speaking in Hindi across my constituency. But people should know that’s AI generated and that’s not really me speaking. And so I think a lot of this is going to go toward proper disclosure.\n\nThere’s a tension there. There’s a reason I ask those two questions back to back. There’s “Will the labor movement contend with AI and get themselves profit sharing?” and “Will we have trucks with drivers in them?” That’s a long-term problem, and it seems like we’re organized around that problem pretty directly. And the problem of “We’re about to flood every social platform and search engine with a bunch of election misinformation powered at scale by AI LLMs,” we have no plans for. Is that a tension that you see reflected? Is that a thing that we can fix?\n\nI do think that we need to pay even more attention on the labor front. I would say that’s not something that has had enough attention because its potential to increase wealth disparity, income disparity, is enormous. But I agree with you that it’s on people’s radar. The second problem, I’m calling in, on February 15th, the top 20 academics in the country to be in DC to have a round table exactly on this. What is the recommendation of the next 10 months that we can do?\n\nWell, it probably isn’t going to be legislative. So what are the guidelines that you want these tech companies to adopt? How do we prevent the proliferation of this information and the targeting of this information? I think that’s the problem with AI, that it may make the targeting of misinformation so much more precise where you know exactly who may be vulnerable to misinformation and be able to get that to them and the creation of misinformation much easier because you now have it being generated through AI. There should ideally be legislation, but in the absence of that, there needs to at least be clear principles and guidelines and agreements by these social media platforms.\n\nDo you think the social media platforms are doing a good job right now supplying trusted information?\n\nNo. I mean, I don’t see how you can look at the current information environment and say that the social media companies are doing a good job. But to their sympathy and to the extent there is any, it’s a hard issue, right? Because there is a tension between free expression in the First Amendment principles and not having a platform proliferate with falsehood and ugliness. And that’s a genuine tension. Where I think there’s low-hanging fruit, and they could do much better, is the addiction on kids.\n\nSo, at the end of last year, I interviewed former President Barack Obama. We talked about the First Amendment in this context. If you want to impose some set of content rules on social media companies, you have to overcome the First Amendment. The government has to make some speech regulations. And I said, “Well, how are you going to do that? How are you going to get around it? There’s no way to do it.” And he looked at me very seriously, and he’s the former president, and it became very clear to me in that moment that he used to be the most powerful person in the world, and I was not. And he was like, “Well, you just got to figure it out.” And he literally walked out of the room. That was the end of our interview. It made it clear, right?\n\nThis is what government is for, to figure out ways to do what people want to do legally, lawfully. I don’t have an idea for what that hook is to say, “Okay, we’re going to go to Instagram and we’re going to say, ‘You can have this content and you cannot have this content that makes young girls feel bad.’” It feels like politically in the United States right now, “Someone think of the children” is that hook, right? It’s the thing that will get us over that First Amendment barrier, but we haven’t quite figured it out. Is that the only hook we have? “Please think of the children,” or is there some other way to make a set of content regulations a floor for content moderation that everyone can agree with?\n\nI’d say a couple points. I think we start with the low-hanging fruit, which is the children. I mean, don’t get the children addicted. Children have First Amendment rights, but it’s subject to more content place requirements, and I think you could get actual bipartisan legislation on that. The second thing is we need to have much more privacy. Because if your data is protected, if we had strong privacy provisions, it becomes harder for these social media companies to target misinformation to you. So the very nature of them having surveillance makes the targeting and misinformation problem worse. The third thing I would say is let’s have multiple platforms. If you’re just beholden to one or two platforms then, again, the misinformation problem is worse. If you have a plurality of places that you could go for speech and conversation, that’s a better scenario.\n\nYou could see sites emerging that say, “Look, we want to have more civil discourse and have the opportunity for them to emerge.” Right now, you have such a monopolization of social media platforms. But the most important point, I think, is that it’s not just about what government can do to regulate, because the regulation of content is very difficult under the First Amendment. It should be difficult. Let me give you a clear example. I put out a statement [on X / Twitter] that the president violated the War Powers by striking Yemen. Twelve hours later, there was a community note saying additional context of the War Powers Resolution and Khanna’s interpretation may not be correct. That community note was taken down 24 hours later because it turns out my interpretation is at least very plausible, if not an absolute truth, because it’s a complex issue and people can have differing interpretations of the Constitution.\n\nSo I’m not sure I want a Twitter board, or an X board, out there saying, “Should we allow Khanna’s statement to remain up there, or should we take it down?” You can imagine the abuses of that kind of power. So there’s a reason we have the First Amendment. So I would say, though, take out the content that’s clearly inciting hate, inciting violence. Take out the content that’s clearly inciting public health crises. You still have a lot of terrible content out there. So how do we deal with this? And this is where I–\n\n... Not to interrupt, but it’s pretty legal to incite hate. It’s pretty legal to incite a public health crisis. To pass a law saying you cannot have content that makes a public health crisis worse… we would still have to overcome the First Amendment that would immediately get challenged and face what would just generally be strict scrutiny, I think, in the courts. That’s the challenge. That’s what I’m focused on here. We’re looking at a bunch of companies in the district that you represent coming up with cannons of content that they’re going to fire onto all these platforms and distribute them, as you said, in more targeted ways than ever before.\n\nAnd people can use them for good or evil or everything in between. I don’t see a framework for how the government can regulate that. There is a brewing consensus that, “Hey, we should protect the children” might overcome some First Amendment challenges. But everything else, it doesn’t seem like we have any ideas on how we do it, and “Maybe we shouldn’t” is a perfectly valid opinion if you believe in the First Amendment. But I’m looking at the next election season, and it seems like maybe we should think about that more constructively, or we should push the platforms to think about it more constructively. Because I don’t know that we’re ready for the cannon of misinformation that is coming because of AI.\n\nI’d say two things to that. I think, obviously, you have a legal background and are well versed in this. I mean, under Brandenburg, the test is very narrow where you have to really show imminent excitement of illegal conduct. So imminent excitement of violence. Now, I’d say in January 6th, some of that line was crossed. I mean, if you have people on Facebook posting that we want to kill the vice president on January 6th at some time, that seems to be pretty much imminent incitement of violence. And one of the things I’d recommend is… Right now, there’s such a broad Section 230 immunity that Facebook doesn’t even have to take that down, even if it’s a violation of Brandenburg. I would say have the ability to go to a court to get a court order to remove the things that are clearly violations and that may incentivize these platforms to remove things that are borderline leading to an incitement of violence.\n\nAnd that should be a reform to Section 230, saying if you have a court order for incitement of illegal conduct. But beyond that, these platforms obviously have their own decisions to make. I sympathize with them in wanting to have First Amendment principles, but I would say that you can have First Amendment principles and still take out things that are clearly hate speech that the government couldn’t take down, but you can take down as a platform. You can take down things that are clearly violations of public health, and you’re going to get criticism. You’re going to say, “Well, this is too broad.” But I think on balance, these companies need to make that decision while having a diversity of view. But the point I do want to make is that all of our focus is on what the companies can and cannot allow on the platform.\n\nNothing is focused on what are the digital platforms we’d like to build, right? After the printing press, there were wars basically for a hundred years because the pamphlets were inciting wars, not just inciting violence. And then we thought, “Okay, how do we create a town hall? How do we have deliberative democratic conversation?” And I think all the digital emphasis has been just on regulating these platforms. How can we do more things like these podcasts and, online, how do we create better forums for democratic deliberation?\n\nSo you mentioned something earlier about markets and competition, right? We shouldn’t just have monopoly social media platforms. There’s a little bit of change now with whatever’s happening with X, whatever is happening with Threads. You can see the rumbles of competition. Threads is still owned by Meta, which is one of the dominant providers of social media services in the world. You used to be an M\u0026A lawyer, in the before time before you entered public service. There’s a lot of just antitrust action in this world, somewhat successfully in the United States, right? It doesn’t all go well. Much more successfully in the EU. They seem to have stopped more deals over there, and certainly they just stopped Adobe and Figma. \n\nAre you seeing that as a place to put some policy pressure to say, “Okay, the giants are giant, we need some competition.” How do we incentivize more competition, richer markets? Maybe it’s better if we have a richer market for information services or social media, and the market can decide an appropriate level of moderation. How do you get from here to there policy-wise?\n\nSo, I was a tech litigation lawyer, not M\u0026A — just don’t want to overstate my credentials. But I think we have to have a lot more scrutiny on these mergers. Facebook should never have been allowed to acquire WhatsApp or Instagram. Imagine if we had more social media spaces. You’d have more content moderation strategies. We’d be able to see what was working and what wasn’t working. We’d be able to call out a really bad actor and say, “Why can’t you adopt a social media strategy like this? They seem to have a better balance.” Instead, we only have a few people making these decisions. So obviously, I wouldn’t ban all mergers or acquisitions. That’s usually the exit for a startup. And if you did that, you’d really hurt the startup space and you’d take all the innovation into just these big companies. They’d all do their work internally. But I think for large mergers, things that are over a billion dollars and that are in a particular industry, we should have a great scrutiny on that.\n\nJust before we jumped on to speak today, I was looking at the news. The EU now has proposed some set of rules around music streaming. The music streaming companies should pay the artists more. That’s a great rule. Maybe it’ll happen, maybe it won’t. The EU is doing this every day. It feels like every day I wake up, and the EU has a new idea about how to regulate tech companies, and most of those happen. The new iPhone has USB-C ports because the EU decided that they were going to have a common charging standard. The Digital Markets Act is going into effect. I’ll pick on Apple again. They’re going to have to split the App Store in two and allow sideloading of apps on iPhones in Europe, on and on and on and on. It feels like we have Big Tech companies here in the United States in your district that are increasingly being more effectively regulated in the consumer interest by the Europeans. How do you close that gap? Is it even worth closing that gap?\n\nWell, first, I wouldn’t just blindly look to Europe.\n\nI feel like the United States politicians saying, “Don’t blindly look to Europe” is the easiest softball.\n\nIt’s that Europe has a lot of regulation. I’ve said this to my European friends directly, but they’ve got one tech company in the last 30 years of any consequence, and that’s ASML, which helps do the semiconductor stitch lithography in Holland.\n\nAnd by the way, for all of their crowing about markets, ASML is a monopoly company, the only provider of that service.\n\nSo if you’re looking at how do we be innovative in the world, and you look at Europe’s done one thing over the last 30 years, it’s probably not the right model. That said there–\n\n... There’s a lot of angry people at Spotify headquarters right now, Representative Khanna. \n\nI should give Spotify an honorable mention. But my point is that they’re also not as effective in regulation as they think because these tech companies, when you look at it, they just go to the least enforcement forum. They’re 19, 20 countries. They’ll often go to the country where the enforcement isn’t happening, and they run circles around the European regulators because the European regulators don’t have the technology proficiency often. So they’ll do dark patterns to get around checking the box. They view it as sort of a speed bump, but not as effective as the Europeans may think. \n\nThat said, I think the United States has been derelict. We have not had a strong privacy legislation. We have not had any AI regulatory agency. We have not had a strong antitrust regulation saying, “If you have an app, you’ve got to have it open to multiple things, and that you’ve got to not charge people a commission on these app stores, and you can’t be privileging your own products.” So we should be focused on how we do a better job here. We can look at some of the best practices of Europe, but my sense is Europe’s tendency is probably to regulate every single possible thing without enough focus on innovation. Our balance has been off and not having sufficient regulation. And what we really need is more people focused on what American regulation should look like, and that I think could be the standard for the world.\n\nDoes that feel bipartisan to you? I feel like there was a bipartisan push toward an antitrust bill last year or the year before that seems to have fizzled out. But it was striking to me that that was a more bipartisan effort, right? Because both sides seem to enjoy hating on Big Tech. Can you get that back? Can anything get done there or are we just waiting until the next election cycle is over?\n\nWe’re waiting until the next election cycle. I like Klobuchar’s bill. I supported that bill despite coming from Silicon Valley and having some of the tech companies not agree with it, and it wasn’t a perfect bill.  But it was better than what we have now, which is just laissez-faire on some of these issues. I do think there’s bipartisan opportunity there to have thoughtful regulation on privacy, thoughtful regulation on antitrust. I think it’s going to take a president getting elected and saying, “This is one of my top priorities.” The tech stuff has gone from being a niche issue to now an issue that people really realize, “Okay, this affects our lives,” but it’s still not high up on the priority list.\n\nI mean, Klobuchar’s bill should have passed, should have been signed. If it’s not perfect, then it can be amended in the future. But there needs to be some US regulation on these issues. But we also need to understand the biggest divide, which is that you’ve got $10 trillion of market value in my district, and you’ve got all these people around the country saying, “How do our kids, how do our young folks get funded, have some participation in a new digital economy? How does this not leave us behind? And what is our strategy toward creating these new economic jobs and opportunities across the country?”\n\nYou mentioned the presidency. You mentioned the president having to prioritize his issues. Earlier in the conversation, you mentioned that President Obama prioritized tech and President Biden hasn’t as much. Do you think that’s something Biden needs to improve, his outreach to the tech community, his cheerleading of better tech regulation, whether it’s privacy or AI or what have you?\n\nYes. I think he could do it in two places. So one, he should set a goal and say, “I want, within the next six months, legislation passed to protect America’s children,” and not just in the State of the Union where he’s alluded to it. I mean to have a task force, have someone in his administration call members of Congress, get it done, and say, “Look, this is unacceptable that our kids are getting addicted to social media.” At dinner, going out and having to post on Instagram, interrupting dinner because they’re so addicted to the worst experiences of junior high on steroids.\n\nI think he needs to do that. He needs to say it’s embarrassing we don’t have privacy legislation. He needs to say that we can’t have Big Tech companies not have appropriate competition. But he also needs to convene these tech leaders and go to rural communities, go to Black and brown communities, and say, “What are you doing to invest in our HBCUs and our HSIs?” We created a program with Google in historically Black colleges in South Carolina. Young folks get an 18-month course, $5,000 stipend, $60,000 to $70,000 jobs at the end of it. How are we getting a hundred thousand new Black and Latino tech jobs? How are we getting more of these jobs in communities in the Rust Belt and across America? I think the president needs to mobilize technology leaders to say, “You’ve got to help create the job opportunities for the next generation.”\n\nWe’ve talked a lot about different social media platforms, the information environment we live in, targeting that information. You’ve talked a lot about the harms to children. It feels like the elephant in the room in that conversation is TikTok. There was a lot of discussion about banning TikTok under the Trump administration that carried through to the Biden administration for a minute. It seems to have all disappeared as we head into an election. Do you think there needs to be more scrutiny of TikTok — its Chinese ownership, how it works at this moment in time — or has that faded to an appropriate level?\n\nYes, it needs to be scrutinized. We shouldn’t have the data be potentially in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. And I’ve said, have the sale be forced to an American company. And there are a lot of things about–\n\nThat’s your position? That TikTok should be sold to an American company?\n\nIt should be sold, but not banned. And I’ll tell you why it shouldn’t be banned. And I don’t love everything on TikTok, and I’m obviously not great at it because we’re still figuring out how do you get one of these videos to go viral? We’re on it on our campaign.\n\nThis one right now, make this one go viral if you’re watching this.\n\nYes, it’s a bit hypocritical because you have all these politicians railing against TikTok, and then they all go to their 25-year-old millennial they know or a Gen Z person they know and say, “Oh, how do I do better on TikTok? I need to get my message out on TikTok.” So a lot of hypocrisy there. \n\nBut look, I don’t agree with everything on TikTok, but the fact that you’ve got all these people on TikTok being critical about our Middle East policy, being critical about our environmental policy. The fact that you’ve got now influencers on TikTok who have more say than boring Congressional house speeches, that’s not a terrible thing. So I think you have to have these technologies be democratizing, give people a voice, but then have guardrails so that they’re not violating privacy, so that the information isn’t going in the wrong hands.\n\nBut there are two types of folks who want to come down against this technology. One, legitimate folks who don’t want the information misused, who don’t want people targeted, who don’t want the spread of misinformation. But there’s a second group, and they just don’t want a threat to the establishment. They don’t like these new voices. They don’t like the fact that people in Congress are losing power and that the establishment is losing power and that suddenly a whole new set of people are having the impact of the conversation. And I have no patience for that second group. And that is the vision, ultimately, of the internet — that at its best, with the appropriate guardrails, it can empower ordinary people to have a voice.\n\nIs there any momentum? Is there any political capital right now to force the sale of TikTok? There was once. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called it one of the weirdest deals he’s ever been a part of. That seems to have gone away.\n\nThere was, and it’s something that I think President Trump and President Biden agreed on. I don’t know the details of where that committee that the president appointed stands, but I think having a forced sale with appropriate compensation and having an American company monitor it would make me a lot more comfortable. I mean, we wouldn’t give up CBC, NBC, or ABC to the Chinese, and yet the channel that’s leading to communication with voters under 30 is in China’s hands. That, to me, is a long-term danger.\n\nYeah. Alright. Last one. We’ll do this one for the TikTok. You’re going to answer this question for the TikTok audience. It’s going to go viral.\n\nAm I finally going to go viral?\n\nIt’s going to happen.\n\nAlright. \n\nExplain to our TikTok audience, as quickly as you can, how you are thinking about regulating generative AI.\n\nThree principles to regulating generative AI. First, you’ve got to know whether something is human or AI generated. Second, make sure generative AI isn’t replacing workers. Make sure workers have a say in their jobs. And third, have basic safety so that generative AI can’t just create massive misinformation or risks to civilization.\n\nIs there a bill people can go look at that contains these principles?\n\nThere is not a bill because to get a bill, you need to have some consensus. I can put out a bill tomorrow. It is not going to go anywhere unless I could get Republicans and senators on board. What I would say is pay attention on February 15th. We have literally the world’s top academics, people who have spent their lives thinking about it. Too often when we want to regulate AI, we think, “Okay, let’s call Elon Musk. Let’s call Sam Altman. Let’s call Bill Gates.” All brilliant people, but they’re not academic neutral experts. I’m calling the 20 leading academic experts in the world, and let’s see what recommendations they give. And I hope that can start to form the basis of bipartisan legislation.\n\nAlright. Representative Khanna, you’ve been amazing. Thank you so much for coming on Decoder.\n\nYou’re an important voice in the debate and conversation. Thank you for having me.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Iowa sues TikTok for setting its App Store age rating too low","alternativeHeadline":"The state of Iowa claims TikTok is lying to parents about the accessibility of mature content on the app.","datePublished":"2024-01-18T15:08:56.258Z","dateModified":"2024-01-18T15:08:56.258Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24042756/iowa-tiktok-lawsuit-app-store-rating","author":[],"articleBody":"TikTok is getting sued by the state of Iowa over claims that it’s lying to parents about the presence of sexual content, drugs, alcohol, profanity, and other inappropriate material in the app. In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird claimed TikTok is making this kind of content “easily accessible” to young users while maintaining an inaccurate “12+” age rating on the Apple App Store.\n\nAs noted in the lawsuit, a 12-plus rating on the App Store means an app has “infrequent/mild” sexual content, profanity, crude humor, suggestive themes, and references to alcohol, tobacco, or drug use. However, the state of Iowa claims the content on TikTok’s app doesn’t fit this description, adding that it would receive a 17-plus label if “correctly” rated by TikTok. The state alleges TikTok’s “T” for “Teen” ratings in the Google Play Store and Microsoft Store are also inaccurate.\n\n\"“TikTok has sneaked past parental blocks by misrepresenting the severity of its content.”\"\n\n“TikTok has kept parents in the dark,” Attorney General Bird said in a statement. “It’s time we shine a light on TikTok for exposing young children to graphic materials such as sexual content, self-harm, illegal drug use, and worse. TikTok has sneaked past parental blocks by misrepresenting the severity of its content.”\n\nAn investigation done by the state found that users as young as 13 years old can “readily find” recipes for alcoholic drinks, “advice and encouragement” about using marijuana, music with profane lyrics, and “videos promoting eating disorders, suicide, and self-harm.” Additionally, the lawsuit claims TikTok’s Restricted Mode, which is supposed to limit content “that may not be appropriate for all audiences,” doesn’t work when enabled.\n\nIowa is seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction under Iowa’s Consumer Fraud Act to stop TikTok from making misleading statements about the presence of inappropriate content in its app. It’s also seeking civil penalties, disgorgement, and other fees. \n\n“TikTok has industry leading safeguards in place for young people, including parental controls and time limits for those under 18,” TikTok spokesperson Alex Haurek said in an emailed statement to The Verge. “We are committed to tackling industry wide challenges and will continue to prioritize community safety.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time TikTok has faced these kinds of allegations. In 2022, Indiana filed a now-dismissed lawsuit against TikTok, alleging the app misled parents about showing sexual and drug-related content to minors. The company is still the subject of several other lawsuits, including one from Utah that claims it makes children “addicted to the app.” TikTok is also facing uncertainty over whether states can legally block young users from signing up for the app without parental permission.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Judge upholds Texas TikTok ban on state employee devices.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-12-12T08:56:00.238Z","dateModified":"2023-12-12T08:56:00.238Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23998084/judge-upholds-texas-tiktok-ban-on-state-employee-devices","author":[],"articleBody":"The ban was challenged by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in July, arguing that it’s “preventing or seriously impeding faculty” from undertaking research related to the app. College students and staff across the state have nevertheless found ways to sneak around the ban.\n\nUS District Judge Robert Pitman rejected the suit on Monday, calling the ban a “reasonable restriction” in light of Texas’ concerns about data privacy.\n\n[Attachment: https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-upholds-texas-tiktok-ban-state-owned-devices-2023-12-11/]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"TikTok’s biggest hits are videos you’ve probably never seen","alternativeHeadline":"The platform’s annual report on the most viral videos and trends shows us once again how siloed the app’s content is.

Seeing something served up on your For You page doesn’t mean it’s a thing all the kids are doing — it just means that the algorithm decided you might watch it based on what you spend your time doing on the app. Out of the bottomless supply of videos posted each day, you’re being fed everything from celebrity clips with millions of views to videos from random accounts with zero likes and zero comments. None of our For You pages look the same by design.\n\nTikTok’s list of “top videos and trends” includes a striking makeup look viewed half a billion times; pet videos; fried chicken ASMR; and a Selena Gomez “get ready with me” skincare routine. Here’s a rundown of the top videos in the US, plus how many views and likes each has as of this writing:\n\n\u003e 1. @dollievision’s makeup routine, 504 million views and 37 million likes\n\u003e 2. @justinflom’s Iron Man DIY, 418 million views and 26 million likes\n\u003e 3. @through.the.lleaves’ large kitten, 394 million views and 32 million likes\n\u003e 4. @selenagomez’s skincare routine, 229 million and 25 million likes \n\u003e 5. @chrishoffish’s parking garage singing, 206 million views and 28 million likes \n\u003e 6. @thezachchoi’s food ASMR, 554 million views and 25 million likes\n\u003e 7. @kaaaathhhhy’s whining French bulldog, 213 million views and 31 million likes\n\u003e 8. @kristy.sarah cutting onions, 172 million views and 24 million likes\n\u003e 9. @tubbynugget’s cartoon affirmation, 102 million views and 15 million likes\n\u003e 10. @bwpottery’s pottery blunders, 185 million views and 10 million likes\n\nUntil today, I’ve seen zero of the top 10 videos, and besides Gomez, have only encountered one of these creators. In my corner of TikTok, none of these are viral — we don’t even know they exist.\n\nAs I wrote last year when TikTok released its 2022 recap, counting down the top-performing content illustrates just how disparate our individual experiences are on one of the most influential platforms of our age. What I’m seeing on TikTok isn’t necessarily what you’re seeing — and according to this recap, the overlap is slim between my For You page and the net average of all TikTok users. How do we make wide-ranging conclusions about an app where a consensus doesn’t exist? And what counts as “viral” on a platform where anyone can rack up half a million views and it would still be a drop in the bucket of attention and not at all representative of “what’s happening on TikTok”? (This spring I posted a video to TikTok that went “viral” — it has had no long-term impact. All that happened was a bunch of people came across it at one point.)\n\nThis ambiguity — and frankly, a generational tension — came to a head this fall after Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7th killed around 1,200 people and took hundreds of hostages. In the weeks following, as a siege on Gaza has left thousands of Palestinians dead, injured, or displaced, attention turned to how many views hashtags related to Israel and Palestine garnered on TikTok. Some said that the popularity of pro-Palestine hashtags on the platform meant that TikTok itself was boosting the content. The company countered that looking purely at hashtag views or videos created with a specific tag doesn’t capture the full scope of how people consume and make content.\n\nThat context laid the groundwork for the claim that followed: that teens are suddenly really into Osama bin Laden because his infamous and violent “Letter to America” manifesto “surged in popularity” on TikTok. But the so-called surge was actually just a trickle: prior to media coverage and the recirculation of the video on Twitter, a few hundred TikToks contained a #lettertoamerica hashtag, amounting to 1.8 million views, according to The Washington Post. Again, it’s an imperfect metric. How many of those viewers watched for more than a few seconds before scrolling past? Does using the hashtag mean you’re co-signing bin Laden?\n\nThe truth is that there are thousands of concurrent terrible takes, niche dramas, and trends happening on TikTok at once, and even with a base of users who are engaging with the content, much of it will never break out to a larger audience. Many people are familiar with “girl dinner” because The New York Times wrote about it, not because they saw it on their For You page. (TikTok named girl dinner as the top trend in the US this year.)\n\nAs the platform continues to grow — and political and cultural forces try to use a video on TikTok as evidence of some larger movement or truth — we need to figure out how to talk about and contextualize this “viral” content. There’s no slowing down the constant churn of things made and served up to get your attention, and it’s easy to feel like your personalized algorithm is real life. But next time, maybe we all need to ask a friend if they’re seeing what we are.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Indiana’s lawsuit against TikTok has been dismissed.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-12-06T01:39:24.322Z","dateModified":"2023-12-06T01:39:24.322Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23990075/indianas-lawsuit-against-tiktok-has-been-dismissed","author":[],"articleBody":"This happened last week, but I saw it today because of Techdirt’s great post about the dismissal.

In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), TikTok says it’s “proactively and aggressively removing this content and investigating how it got onto our platform.”\n\nDozens of videos about the manifesto, titled “Letter to America,” have surfaced on TikTok over the past several days, with CNN reporting the topic amassed “at least” 14 million views by Thursday. Originally published in 2002, the manifesto criticizes the US government’s presence in the Middle East and support of Israel. However, some creators are now trying to apply that criticism to the US government’s response to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\n[Media: https://x.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1725198557936852994?s=20]\n\nOne video, which has since been removed from TikTok, had a text overlay saying “trying to go back to life as normal after reading Osama Bin Laden’s ‘Letter to America’ and realizing everything we learned about the Middle East, 9/11, and ‘terrorism’ was a lie.”\n\nTikTok no longer shows any results when you attempt to search for “Letter to America,” and the Guardian, which published a translated version of the letter in 2002, took it down on Wednesday after it began circulating on the platform. When it was first published, the Guardian said the letter was circulated among “British Islamic extremists.”\n\n“Content promoting this letter clearly violates our rules on supporting any form of terrorism,” TikTok writes on X. “This is not unique to TikTok and has appeared across multiple platforms and the media.” TikTok adds the number of videos posted on the topic is “small and reports of it trending on our platform are inaccurate.”\n\nEarlier this week, TikTok pushed back on claims it was lenient on pro-Palestinian content, claiming both Instagram and Facebook also had more posts tagged with #FreePalestine than #standwithIsrael. The platform says it also doesn’t allow “inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.” \n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has been a huge test for TikTok, and the platform will only continue to face pressure to strictly moderate its content, especially since nearly one-third of young adults use TikTok to get their news.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Nearly one-third of young adults are regularly getting news from TikTok.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-11-15T20:17:34.697Z","dateModified":"2023-11-15T20:17:34.697Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/23962766/nearly-one-third-of-young-adults-are-regularly-getting-news-from-tiktok","author":[],"articleBody":"In 2020, the share of Americans age 18-29 who could say the same was just 9 percent, according to a new poll from Pew Research.

US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected the social media giants’ motion to dismiss the dozens of lawsuits accusing the companies of running platforms “addictive” to kids.\n\nSchool districts across the US have filed suit against Meta, ByteDance, Alphabet, and Snap, alleging the companies cause physical and emotional harm to children. Meanwhile, 42 states sued Meta last month over claims Facebook and Instagram “profoundly altered the psychological and social realities of a generation of young Americans.” This order addresses the individual suits and “over 140 actions” taken against the companies.\n\nTuesday’s ruling states that the First Amendment and Section 230, which says online platforms shouldn’t be treated as the publishers of third-party content, don’t shield Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat from all liability in this case. Judge Gonzalez Rogers notes many of the claims laid out by the plaintiffs don’t “constitute free speech or expression,” as they have to do with alleged “defects” on the platforms themselves. That includes having insufficient parental controls, no “robust” age verification systems, and a difficult account deletion process.\n\n“Addressing these defects would not require that defendants change how or what speech they disseminate,” Judge Gonzalez Rogers writes. “For example, parental notifications could plausibly empower parents to limit their children’s access to the platform or discuss platform use with them.”\n\nHowever, Judge Gonzalez Rogers still threw out some of the other “defects” identified by the plaintiffs because they’re protected under Section 230, such as offering a beginning and end to a feed, recommending children’s accounts to adults, the use of “addictive” algorithms, and not putting limits on the amount of time spent on the platforms.\n\n“Today’s decision is a significant victory for the families that have been harmed by the dangers of social media,” the lead lawyers representing the plaintiffs, Lexi Hazam, Previn Warren, and Chris Seeger, say in a joint statement. “The Court’s ruling repudiates Big Tech’s overbroad and incorrect claim that Section 230 or the First Amendment should grant them blanket immunity for the harm they cause to their users.”\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda says the allegations in these complaints are “simply not true,” adding the company has “built age-appropriate experiences for kids and families on YouTube, and provide parents with robust controls.” Snap declined to comment, while Meta and ByteDance didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.\n\nNumerous lawsuits have argued that online platforms include “defective” features that hurt users, but these claims — including a high-profile suit over harassment on Grindr — have often been thrown out in court. As more studies show evidence of the potential harm social platforms may be causing children, lawmakers have pushed to pass new laws specifically targeting child safety, including requirements for age verification. This ruling doesn’t determine that social platforms are causing harm or hold them legally liable for it, but it could still pave the way for a slew of safety claims even without new laws — and make the legal defense against them harder.\n\nUpdate November 14th, 4:26PM ET: Added a statement from Google.\n\nUpdate November 14th, 5:15PM ET: Added that Snap declined to comment.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"The EU is looking into Meta and TikTok’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war","alternativeHeadline":"The European Commission is requesting information from Meta and TikTok over illegal content and disinformation related to the war in Israel.","datePublished":"2023-10-19T14:19:54.198Z","dateModified":"2023-10-19T14:19:54.198Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/19/23923768/eu-digital-services-act-meta-tiktok-violations-israel-hamas-war","author":[],"articleBody":"The European Commission is formally requesting information from Meta and TikTok on how they’re handling illegal content and disinformation related to the war in Israel.

As a full-time content creator with over 10,000 followers on the platform, the app was central to his life. Would he be forced to delete it? Would he be punished if he were caught using it?\n\n“I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, are you serious?’” Aaberg recalls. “That’s so BS. There’s no way.” \n\nThen he learned the reality. UTD was making TikTok inaccessible on its campus-provided networks. For him, that was the extent of the ban. \n\nAaberg immediately relaxed. “I was like, ‘Oh, that’s nothing,’” he says. \n\nTexas is one of over thirty US states that have enacted restrictions on the use of TikTok. The complaints, broadly, have to do with the app’s alleged ties to China. “Owned by a Chinese company that employs Chinese Communist Party members, TikTok harvests significant amounts of data from a user’s device, including details about a user’s internet activity,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said when announcing the ban.\n\nSome of the restrictions, such as the one Montana Governor Greg Gianforte signed a few months ago, are far-reaching, stipulating broadly that TikTok may not operate within the state. That law is set to take effect next year.\n\nBut for most — Texas included — the restrictions extend merely to government entities. Agencies have been tasked with eliminating the use of the platform on state-issued devices (as well as personal devices used for state business) and Wi-Fi networks. Those agencies include state universities. \n\nBans like those of Montana and Texas have been met with major opposition online and in court. “The law creates a prior restraint on expression that violates the First Amendment, depriving Montanans of access to a forum that for many is a principal source for knowing current events,” reads one such lawsuit, which also argues that TikTok users, were the ban to move forward, would suffer “irreparable harm.”\n\nAnd for faculty at universities like UTD, the bans can be disruptive and career-damaging. The Knight First Amendment Institute recently filed to expedite a suit against the Texas law, which it says has hurt professors’ ability to conduct research on a social media juggernaut — including on some of the very topics that have lawmakers worried, like disinformation. Faculty in Texas are expected to keep TikTok off any device they use for university business, including school-issued laptops and phones. That makes it difficult to conduct large-scale research of the platform or cite individual videos in class. “The TikTok ban has imposed profound burdens on my teaching and research,” wrote University of North Texas professor Jacqueline Vickery, whose work covers online media literacy, in a supporting brief.\n\nTikTok has sued. Users have sued. The ACLU and other free speech advocates have filed briefs. In many ways, the laws stand at the forefront of rising geopolitical tensions between China and the West and at the center of evolving domestic debates around the balancing of liberty and national security.\n\nBut among college students — by far the demographic who use the app the most — the reaction has been much more subdued. It’s best summed up, students say, as a collective eye roll and a quick jump into the Settings app.\n\n\"“They really just did not care”\"\n\nThomas Pablo, a sophomore at the University of Oklahoma, describes the day his school announced a TikTok ban as an utter non-event. \n\n“It was just another Monday,” he recalls. \n\nIt happened suddenly — one day, TikToks loaded in the app and in mobile browsers, and the next day, they didn’t. But Pablo and all of his friends knew instinctively what to do: turn off the Wi-Fi and use data. For the past several months since the ban, he’s been switching his phone’s internet on and off around four times per day. Others he knows do it much more often. \n\nPablo never discussed or brainstormed methods with other students, nor did he hear any outcry about the new restriction. The student body, quietly, in unison, added Wi-Fi toggling to their daily routine. “Everyone was so nonchalant about it,” Pablo says. “They really just did not care.” \n\n“There wasn’t a whole lot of pushback, aside from a lot of grumbling and groans,” says Ana Renfroe, a sophomore at Texas A\u0026M. Some of her professors are still showing TikToks in class. They’ll just ask students to download the videos at home she explains, or will upload them to another platform like Instagram Reels. \n\nEthan Walker, a senior at East Tennessee State University, feels the same way. “I just turn off my Wi-Fi, and it just loads right off the bat,” Walker says. “It’s a really easy workaround.” \n\nWalker understands, to an extent, where the state of Tennessee is coming from. He did a lot of research when the ban was first announced, and he admits that the app’s data collection scares him. Nevertheless, TikTok is so central to his campus’s culture that he doesn’t feel that he can leave. “To be involved in social life, you have to be at least versed in some of the TikTok trends,” he says. \n\nWalker now turns his Wi-Fi on and off around five times a day. It was a routine that took some adjusting; he’d sometimes forget that his Wi-Fi was off and end up using data all day. But he’s used to it now. If he wants to open TikTok, his fingers navigate to Wi-Fi settings automatically. “It’s honestly just part of my routine,” he says. \n\nThis experience is a common one at ETSU — Walker doesn’t know a single person who has given up the app. “It’s like trying to ban meth,” he explains. “Of course people are going to find meth.”\n\n\"“It’s like trying to ban meth”\"\n\nThe influx of students rushing to data networks may be having some impact on their speeds. Virginia banned TikTok over the summer. Jackson Moyer, a senior at Virginia Tech, doesn’t use TikTok himself but has found the university’s data network to be abysmally slow since he returned to campus for the fall semester. New students couldn’t figure out the bus system because the navigation app wouldn’t load. GroupMe messages wouldn’t go through. He recently tried to open a PDF during a class change when crowds of students were streaming between buildings and found that he couldn’t. He asked a friend to try — the friend couldn’t load it either. \n\n“It was a pretty high-resolution PDF, but like, I expect to be able to load a PDF on my phone,” Moyer complains.\n\nCellular data is notoriously slow in crowded areas. That’s why carriers often install extra network-boosting equipment at major sporting events, and it was a big reason behind the push for 5G at large gatherings like the NFL Draft, which see tens of thousands of fans trying to stream on such networks at once. The extent to which campus TikTok streaming might impact such speeds is difficult to prove; Virginia Tech has around thirty-seven thousand attendees, which may not provide comparable demand to the audience of a large stadium. \n\nStill, other students have also reported seeing congestion, particularly in the early days of their campuses’ TikTok bans. For a while, Pablo had trouble getting Spotify tracks to play. “I do remember it noticeably being slower,” he says. “It was just kind of a mild nuisance.”\n\n“In the library, it’s getting bad,” Walker says. “The data has gotten noticeably worse there.” (Reached for comment, representatives from OU and ETSU said they were not aware of the issue. Virginia Tech did not respond to a request for comment by press time.) \n\nStill, the only time where the TikTok bans present a true obstacle is in areas with no cell service. Renfroe is an editor for her school’s student newspaper, which means she has to spend quite a bit of time working in a basement office where she doesn’t get signal. There, she has to employ an absolute last resort to entertain herself: Instagram Reels. \n\nIt’s not the same. “I wouldn’t describe Instagram Reels as containing peak comedy,” she explains ruefully — jokes and trends that originate on TikTok will often take “like, three months” to make their way over. “It’s just something to watch.” \n\nOther students have turned to VPNs. The cellular networks on UT Dallas’s campus are too slow for Aaberg’s purposes. He’s been using Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 to access TikTok, and he loves it. He’s trying to convince his friends, many of whom have made jumped to Instagram Reels, to do the same. It’s been a tough sell. “I’m like, girl, just download a VPN, it’s not that hard,” he says. But, he concedes, “most of my friends don’t even know what VPN stands for.”\n\n\"“Girl, just download a VPN”\"\n\nThe future of TikTok bans is uncertain. The numerous suits against them argue that the rules constitute an overly broad and unjustified First Amendment limit; in 2020, a series of court rulings blocked former President Donald Trump’s early attempts to ban the app nationwide. \n\nThe Knight First Amendment Institute has asked a judge to immediately exempt Texas faculty from the restrictions while a larger legal challenge is ongoing. “These bans are impeding vital research about one of the most important communications platforms today,” staff attorney Ramya Krishnan tells The Verge. If states want to prevent potential privacy harms, Krishnan says, they should consider tightening the rules on domestic data brokers — who quietly sell much of the same information TikTok hawks fear might leak to China, no ByteDance app required.\n\nAt this point, however, many students have been living without TikTok on Wi-Fi for weeks to months. If switching to data and braving slow speeds was annoying, it’s now become routine. “I definitely miss it,” Renfroe says of the TikTok-on-Wi-Fi days. But, “we’ve already settled into it. We’ve kind of been living with it now for two semesters. It’s not exactly at the forefront of my mind.”\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"In a bid to please regulators, TikTok opens its first EU data center in Ireland","alternativeHeadline":"TikTok has started routing European user data through its data center in Dublin, Ireland.","datePublished":"2023-09-05T13:51:47.787Z","dateModified":"2023-09-05T13:51:47.787Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23859499/tiktok-first-eu-data-center-ireland-launch","author":[],"articleBody":"TikTok has started transferring European user information to its newly launched data center in Ireland.

It's already happening]\n\nTikTok’s lawsuit follows much of the criticism civil liberties groups like the ACLU have raised since the bill was first passed by the Montana state legislature in April. The suit claims that the ban is unconstitutional and violates the First Amendment. TikTok also argues that it’s unlawful for states to implement these bans, claiming that the federal government has the sole authority to remedy threats to national security.\n\nTikTok’s Monday suit is the second challenging the Montana ban. Last Thursday, a group of TikTok creators filed their own lawsuit, calling it unconstitutional and infringing on their free speech rights.\n\nWhile Montana’s ban is the first state ban to be approved, TikTok has previously challenged other federal attempts to ban its app nationwide. US federal judges have blocked attempts to ban that and other Chinese apps like WeChat, stemming from executive orders signed by former President Donald Trump. \n\nLast Thursday, Eric Ebenstein, TikTok’s vice president for public policy, told CNN that the national security complaints raised by Montana, state lawmakers, and federal policymakers were unjustified. \n\n“National security concerns are rightly within the purview of the federal government,” Ebenstein said Thursday. “That’s not within the basis of governance for Montana or any other state.

The suit, filed last night and announced today, alleges that Montana’s SB 419 is an unconstitutional and overly broad infringement of their right to speech. \n\n“Montana has no authority to enact laws advancing what it believes should be the United States’ foreign policy or its national security interests, nor may Montana ban an entire forum for communication based on its perceptions that some speech shared through that forum, though protected by the First Amendment, is dangerous,” says the suit, filed by law firm Davis Wright Tremaine. “Montana can no more ban its residents from viewing or posting to TikTok than it could ban the Wall Street Journal because of who owns it or the ideas it publishes.”\n\nDavis Wright Tremaine was behind a similar suit filed by TikTok users in 2020 after then-President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning the ByteDance-owned app. Trump, like Montana lawmakers, claimed that TikTok’s Chinese ownership made it a national security threat. The firm successfully secured a temporary halt to the order — which was later revoked by incoming President Joe Biden.\n\nThis week’s lawsuit attacks the Montana law on several fronts. It argues that Montana is depriving state residents of a forum for sharing and receiving speech, violating their First Amendment rights. It also argues that SB 419 violates the Commerce Clause by effectively restricting interstate commerce. And it says the law is preempted by federal sanctions powers.\n\nThe suit defends TikTok as a way to learn about current affairs, promote local businesses, and “showcase the natural beauty” of Montana, offering a counterpoint to SB 419’s claims that the app encourages dangerous stunts and promotes inappropriate content. Its plaintiffs include the owner of a small Montana-based swimwear business that has gained a following on TikTok, as well as a US Marine Corps veteran, a college student, a rancher, and a comedian, all of whom share videos and make money through the app.\n\nRestricting app access on a state-by-state basis raises numerous logistical problems for TikTok, mobile app stores, and users. SB 419 says that TikTok “may not operate” within the state of Montana and that storefronts like the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store may not offer it for download at risk of fines. (Users would not be penalized for accessing TikTok.) As noted by the lawsuit, Governor Greg Gianforte unsuccessfully attempted to rewrite the bill to address concerns before signing it. The law would be declared void if TikTok is spun off from Chinese ownership or if federal lawmakers passed their own TikTok ban like the RESTRICT Act. Otherwise, it’s set to take effect in January of 2024 — unless this legal challenge, or one like it, successfully blocks the rule.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Can you even watch this video in Montana?","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-05-17T23:56:54.958Z","dateModified":"2023-05-17T23:56:54.958Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/17/23727844/can-you-even-watch-this-video-in-montana","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Makena Kelly","url":"https://www.theverge.com/authors/makena-kelly"}],"articleBody":"Well, maybe not in 2024 if a new law banning TikTok within the state takes effect.

He also accused Telegram, WeChat, and the shopping app Temu of being “tied to foreign adversaries” and directed that they and similar apps be banned from government devices and all state business. Gianforte also cited TikTok owner ByteDance’s CapCut video editor and Lemon8 as examples of offending apps.\n\nWith this ban, Gianforte largely seems to be targeting apps with ties to China, given that ByteDance, Temu owner Pinduoduo, and WeChat owner Tencent are all based in the country.\n\nTelegram is the exception: Gianforte’s letter claims that the app was founded in Russia and that the Russian government uses the app to “monitor users and obtain personal, sensitive, confidential information,” perhaps referencing Wired’s February report. However, Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn tells The Verge that “the legal entity controlling Telegram at launch was located in the British Virgin Islands.” Telegram is currently headquartered in Dubai. Vaughn also said that “Telegram has never provided user data to the Russian government” and that the app’s messages are “securely encrypted and cannot be intercepted.”\n\n[Media: https://twitter.com/GovGianforte/status/1658957949061185536]\n\nMontana’s new policy will be in effect on June 1st. The list of devices that can’t have the apps includes “all state-issued cell phones, laptops, tablets, desktop computers, and other devices which connect to the internet.” And the ban won’t just apply to government employees: Gianforte says that “any third-party firms conducting business for or on behalf of the State of Montana shall not use these applications.”\n\nGianforte had already blocked TikTok on government devices or devices connected to the state network as of December, so this expands that policy to a suite of other major apps. WeChat and Telegram Messenger are widely-used for chats, for example, and shopping app Temu is currently the most popular free app in the US in the App Store and Google Play. If the offending apps are currently downloaded on any devices, Gianforte has instructed them to be “immediately removed.”\n\nDespite Gianforte’s claims it’s “well-documented” that TikTok provides personal information and data to the Chinese Communist Party, it’s unclear if owner ByteDance actually relays that data back to the government. But as we reported in March, Congress doesn’t seem particularly interested in the answers — many have already made up their minds.\n\nCorrection May 18th, 2:06PM ET: We originally wrote that Telegram was founded in Russia.

The bill, SB 419, prohibits TikTok from operating “within the territorial jurisdiction of Montana” and demands mobile app stores make the app unavailable for Montana residents.\n\n“To protect Montanans’ personal and private data from the Chinese Communist Party, I have banned TikTok in Montana,” Gianforte tweeted today.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter responded with a statement on Twitter. “Governor Gianforte has signed a bill that infringes on the First Amendment rights of the people of #Montana by unlawfully banning #TikTok, a platform that empowers hundreds of thousands of people across the state,” Oberwetter wrote. “We want to reassure Montanans that they can continue using TikTok to express themselves, earn a living, and find community as we continue working to defend the rights of our users inside and outside of Montana.”\n\n[Media: https://twitter.com/brookeob1/status/1658966895230369798?s=61\u0026t=-OWBWFnLYwHzH1uVuP5nNw]\n\nThis is a huge step toward a new kind of internet — one where states are increasingly erecting digital barriers in the name of safety and security. But the law also won’t kick in for months, if it comes into effect at all. Here’s what’s going on.\n\nWhat does Montana’s TikTok ban say?\n\nSB 419 is a relatively simple law. It declares that “TikTok may not operate within the territorial jurisdiction of Montana.” And it says that mobile app stores may not offer “the option to download the TikTok mobile application.” An earlier provision would have banned internet service providers from allowing people to access the app, but that didn’t make it into the final text.\n\nThe law specifies that no penalties apply to users of TikTok. But app store operators and TikTok itself could face fines of $10,000 per violation per day, with an individual violation defined as “each time that a user accesses TikTok, is offered the ability to access TikTok, or is offered the ability to download TikTok.”\n\n[Media: https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7234289640642022699]\n\nThere’s a little ambiguity here. The bill doesn’t state, for instance, whether letting people access TikTok’s rudimentary web interface would count as “operating” within Montana. The bill only penalizes app stores for “the option to download,” but it doesn’t lay out the liability for ongoing updates to already-downloaded apps. (It’s likely they’re supposed to be banned too, but Apple and Google could try to argue otherwise.)\n\nThe ban would be an unprecedented restriction on Americans’ access to the internet. But it won’t go into effect right away. The law is effective January 1st, 2024, by default. On top of that, there’s a significant loophole: it’s voided automatically if TikTok severs its ties to Chinese parent company ByteDance, as long as its new owner isn’t located in a “foreign adversary” nation.\n\nIs the Montana ban legal?\n\nThere’s no hard legal precedent for something like the TikTok ban, so we don’t know for sure. We do know, however, that the ban will probably be challenged immediately. Although TikTok hasn’t said it will sue, it calls the rule an “egregious government overreach” and said that it would fight it. The internet trade association NetChoice, which represents companies like Meta, Twitter, and Google, has issued a statement calling the bill “plainly unconstitutional.” NetChoice has sued states including Texas, Florida, and California over other bills that regulate online speech, so Montana may well be next.\n\nNetChoice argues that SB 419 is an unconstitutional “bill of attainder,” or a regulation that accuses a specific entity of a crime and punishes them without a trial. It also contends that the law violates the First Amendment, “restricting Americans’ ability to share and receive constitutionally-protected speech online.”\n\nJameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, has previously laid out the First Amendment case against TikTok bans. “It’s conceivable that the US government will eventually be able to establish the necessity of a ban on TikTok, even if it hasn’t done so yet,” Jaffer wrote in March as momentum behind a federal TikTok ban was building. “But the First Amendment would require the government to carry a heavy burden of justification.” That argument goes for Montana as much as the federal government.\n\nAt least a few US judges have reached the same conclusion. In 2020, courts blocked then-president Donald Trump’s executive orders banning TikTok and the similarly Chinese-owned WeChat, concluding that the Trump administration hadn’t demonstrated a security risk worth shutting down users’ speech. These executive orders were reversed when President Joe Biden took office, so the cases never reached a final ruling — but so far, Chinese apps have fared better in court than the politicians trying to ban them.\n\n[Video: TikTok Hearing]\n\nIs there a good reason to ban TikTok?\n\nThis has been debated for years, and the answer is still “nobody knows.” The Montana bill’s introduction claims that “TikTok gathers significant information from its users, accessing data against their will to share with the People’s Republic of China.” But while there’s a strong argument TikTok could share such data, we don’t know if that’s actually happening. And that probably won’t change until journalists, intelligence officials, and / or whistleblowers release new details.\n\nThat’s not a very satisfying answer, so I’ll confess that this question is mainly an excuse to post SB 419’s entertainingly lurid descriptions of TikTok challenges. Part of the bill’s justification is that TikTok (allegedly) “fails to remove, and may even promote, dangerous content that directs minors to engage in dangerous activities.” It then throws in nearly every negative TikTok trend of the past several years:\n\n\u003e Throwing objects at moving automobiles, taking excessive amounts of medication, lighting a mirror on fire and then attempting to extinguish it using only one’s body parts, inducing unconsciousness through oxygen deprivation, cooking chicken in NyQuil, pouring hot wax on a user’s face, attempting to break an unsuspecting passerby’s skull by tripping him or her into landing face first into a hard surface, placing metal objects in electrical outlets, swerving cars at high rates of speed, smearing human feces on toddlers, licking doorknobs and toilet seats to place oneself at risk of contracting coronavirus, attempting to climb stacks of milkcrates, shooting passersby with air rifles, loosening lug nuts on vehicles, and stealing utilities from public places.\n\nNow, some of these challenges have reportedly caused real-world harm, but others gained infamy mostly because well-meaning outsiders warned about them, not because people were actually trying them. “Cooking chicken in NyQuil,” for instance, was a viral joke that only began trending more broadly when the Food and Drug Administration amplified it with a bulletin. TikTok is also far from the only place where people encourage each other to do stupid things online. And Montana lawmakers aren’t banning YouTube or Facebook... because protecting speech you find distasteful or dangerous is a pretty key element of the First Amendment.\n\nHow does this intersect with the larger TikTok ban effort?\n\nMontana is the first US legislature to pass a full TikTok ban. But several states, including Montana, have passed restrictions that apply to universities or government-issued devices. Gianforte added new restrictions making that ban apply to more apps today.\n\n[Media: https://twitter.com/GovGianforte/status/1658957949061185536]\n\nAnd at the federal level, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have pushed to ban TikTok. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared before Congress in March to answer questions about the app’s alleged national security risks and effects on children, but he left legislators apparently unmoved.\n\nFor at least some politicians, a ban is a last-ditch nuclear option rather than a first response. The RESTRICT Act, which so far seems like the most favored TikTok-banning bill, opens the door to various mitigation measures short of a ban. (The RESTRICT Act has started to face some opposition in Congress but not necessarily enough to tip the scales.)

Han has been leading TikTok’s safety teams in the US for several years, and in December, he was named the head of trust and safety for TikTok US Data Security (USDS), a separate entity created to convince the government that the app shouldn’t be banned.\n\nIn the memo to employees announcing his departure, Andy Bonillo, interim USDS general manager, said he will be “stepping in to lead USDS T\u0026S on an interim basis” until “we identify Eric’s replacement for the longer term.” Bonillo’s title already says “interim” because the US government has yet to approve TikTok’s USDS proposal and would ultimately have the final say on who runs it.\n\n“Over the past four years, Eric helped safeguard our U.S. community through an incredible stage of growth,” Bonillo said in the memo. “We remain dedicated to upholding our commitments to the TikTok community - both in the U.S. and around the world - as we continue to invest in trust and safety as a cornerstone of those efforts.”\n\nAfter this story was published, TikTok spokesperson Maureen Shanahan emailed me to say that Han’s role specifically focused on the “compliance, safety strategies, and moderation for content involving US users’ private data.” The implication is that he had little to no oversight of, say, the trust and safety efforts for TikTok’s video recommendations in the US, despite the company saying in December that he was leading the company’s US legal policy and threat intelligence teams in his new role. \n\n“Outside USDS, TikTok’s global Trust and Safety team oversees the platform’s safety policies, processes, and systems for our global community, including the US,” Shanahan wrote in the email. “TikTok’s Head of Trust and Safety is based in Dublin with leaders across the US, Ireland, and Singapore. Our global Trust and Safety team develops global safety policies for the platform and oversees moderation of content that does not involve US users’ private data.”\n\nTikTok’s fate in the US feels as uncertain as ever right now, with states like Montana trying to ban the app and the bipartisan RESTRICT Act making its way through Congress. The Biden administration has sent smoke signals indicating that TikTok’s USDS proposal isn’t enough to appease its national security concerns and that it will likely demand a full divestiture of TikTok from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The Chinese government obviously doesn’t like that idea, which, as the saying goes, puts TikTok between a rock and a hard place.\n\nUpdate May 2nd, 6:13PM ET: Added response from TikTok spokesperson.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Republicans demand a ban on lawmakers using TikTok","alternativeHeadline":"Congress has already banned TikTok from government-issued devices.","datePublished":"2023-04-18T18:58:36.984Z","dateModified":"2023-04-18T18:58:36.984Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23688361/tiktok-ban-congress-republicans-aoc-china-bytedance","author":[],"articleBody":"A group of Republican lawmakers are calling on their colleagues to stop using TikTok as pressure mounts to ban the app nationwide.\n\nIn letters to the Senate and House rules committees, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rep. Dan Crenshaw, and more than a dozen other Republicans demanded that the panels ban elected officials from using TikTok. Last year, Congress and a handful of state legislatures banned the app on government-owned devices, but these rules do not currently apply to members’ personal phones and devices. \n\n“It is troublesome that some members continue to disregard these clear warnings and are even encouraging their constituents to use TikTok to interface with their elected representatives — especially since some of these users are minors. We feel this situation warrants further action to protect the privacy of both sensitive congressional information and the personal information of our constituents,” the lawmakers wrote. \n\n\"Even though Congress has moved to ban TikTok over the last few months, some lawmakers have continued to use the app\"\n\nIn order to approve a ban on officials using TikTok, the committees would need to amend standing House and Senate rules to include language barring members from using the app. It’s likely that they would hold hearings related to the proposed change before putting the new language up to a series of votes for approval.\n\nEven though Congress has moved to ban TikTok over the last few months, some lawmakers have continued to use the app to engage with their constituents online. Many members who use TikTok, like Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY), have garnered significant followings by posting videos explaining legislation and responding to news events. \n\nBowman, who has over 200,000 followers on TikTok, led a press conference at the Capitol last month opposing a ban on the app. More than 20 TikTok creators, flown out by the company, and two other House Democrats joined Bowman at the presser. Since the event, more Democrats, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY) and Ilhan Omar (MN), have made statements condemning efforts to ban the app. \n\n“If we want to make a decision as significant as banning TikTok, and we believe — or someone believes — that there is really important information that the public deserves to know about why such a decision would be justified, that information should be shared,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a TikTok video last month. \n\nIn March, the House Energy and Commerce Committee brought in TikTok’s CEO Shou Zi Chew to respond to questions about the app’s security practices. For more than three years, lawmakers have argued that the app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, could be used by the Chinese government to spy on American citizens.\n\n“Some members of Congress who regularly use the app have minimized the security threat to our nation, and their defense is not compelling, considering there are several popular social media apps that are not at the same risk for the potential transfer of sensitive, private information to an adversarial foreign government,” the lawmakers wrote.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Montana state legislature votes to ban TikTok from app stores in the state.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-04-14T23:09:03.588Z","dateModified":"2023-04-14T23:09:03.588Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/14/23684071/montana-state-legislature-votes-to-ban-tiktok-from-app-stores-in-the-state","author":[],"articleBody":"The bill (PDF) now waits to be signed by Montana governor Greg Gianforte.

At a time of heightened partisanship, TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, have become the focus of anti-China policy — a convenient villain most lawmakers are prepared to fight. \n\nLast month, that outrage hit a fever pitch. The Biden administration reportedly threatened to ban TikTok if it didn’t find an American owner. House lawmakers brought the company’s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, in for an explosive hearing. At the same time, a group of senators introduced the RESTRICT Act, a bill authorizing the government to ban the app and others like it. This maelstrom of action has proved that the government is more determined to ban TikTok than ever before. \n\nBut with a ban seemingly on the horizon, critics fear actions to take TikTok offline could do more to chill free speech on the internet than to protect the safety and security of American user data.

I spent the rest of the year accessing my friends’ status updates through Tor and an increasingly shady series of VPNs, constantly bemused by the experience of typing an address into a browser and being unable to reach it. This was the World Wide Web! The information superhighway! And here I was, walled off from a huge section of it in the name of being protected from the dangers of information itself.\n\nIt’s hard to describe how strange it feels to sit in New York City in 2023 watching American politicians propose fighting Chinese authoritarianism with their own social media ban.\n\nLast Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in an abrasive hearing that mainly revealed one thing: Congress really, really wants to ban TikTok. Several members made gestures at the idea that this was part of some larger “Big Tech” accountability push, but they spent far more time finding grammatically creative ways to insert the word “communist” into sentences. A prevailing attitude seemed to be something like “we can’t do anything else to govern tech companies, so why not this?”\n\n\"Banning TikTok is not a signal we’re about to get real tech reform\"\n\nBanning TikTok is not, as lawmakers claimed in the hearing, a sign that we’re about to get real tech reform. It will almost certainly be a PR move that lets some of the same politicians who profess outrage at TikTok get back to letting everyone from Comcast to the DMV sell your personal information, looking the other way while cops buy records of your movements or arrest you using faulty facial recognition and getting mad you’re allowed to have encryption that prevents the FBI (and probably also foreign governments) from hacking your phone. And it will be a PR move that betrays America’s supposed commitment to free expression in the face of an increasingly splintered internet — born out of a failure to think bigger than one disfavored app.\n\nIt’s almost impossible to tell how grounded the national security concerns about TikTok are in solid evidence. It’s definitely true that the Chinese government exercises tight control over the country’s technology industry, when it’s not busy disappearing tech investors. Some of its tech companies have helped construct a nightmare surveillance state that’s facilitating genocide. And there is almost nothing TikTok can do to prove American user data isn’t vulnerable to Chinese government surveillance in some way, despite its elaborate attempts to let Oracle host its data. As long as TikTok is connected to Chinese parent company ByteDance, the possibility is there.\n\nIt’s much easier, however, to conclude that the concrete benefit of America banning TikTok for all citizens is dubious. From a privacy perspective, much of what Chinese authorities would likely want from TikTok (including very detailed geolocation data) is readily available from American data brokers. Phones are already little surveillance machines with or without TikTok, and there are countless other ways to get information off of them. So far, there’s more concrete evidence of Tim Hortons secretly tracking the average app user than TikTok.\n\n\"TikTok has a clear moderation bias, but it’s one lots of Americans seem to agree with\"\n\nThe claims that TikTok will become a covert Chinese Communist Party (CCP) propaganda channel are similarly possible but hypothetical. According to leaked documents, TikTok has clearly had moderation biases at various parts of its lifespan, but they’ve seemed as much aligned to a kind of anodyne positivity as a specific national agenda. Tiananmen Square videos were apparently suppressed at one point, for instance, but so was criticizing any governmental system. Its clearest censorship drive is against the basic concepts of sex, drugs, and violence — which certainly aligns with the CCP but also describes what lots of Americans want from social media, as evidenced by how many lawmakers asked why TikTok wasn’t banning those things as well as its Chinese counterpart Douyin allegedly does. It’s not that TikTok couldn’t be weaponized here, but it seems more cause for vigilance than five-alarm panic.\n\nI’ve seen the argument that because many states and agencies have banned TikTok on government devices, they must know something ominous that we don’t. That’s possible, too, but government agencies are facing higher stakes than the average user and often act out of an abundance of caution. The military took years to let members officially use Android phones; it’s not surprising for government-owned devices to be subject to tighter standards than consumer ones. Also, many of these bans are getting passed by state legislators, who are subject to all the same public pressures and incentives as their counterparts in Washington.\n\n\"There are other options on the table, but after last week, a ban seems closer than ever\"\n\nTikTok’s known bad behavior seems unfortunately in line with the average tech company, and a forced sale to a US company will probably just let it sweep future offenses under the rug with less scrutiny. Employees have plausibly snooped on data from the accounts of journalists at least once — but so did Uber, and it’s still operating just fine. A team at eBay carried out a bizarre anti-journalist stalking campaign that saw the arrest of several employees, but so far, there have been few consequences for the company itself. As many reasonable people have pointed out, the clearest solution is to pass real privacy, security, transparency, and other accountability rules, not do Silicon Valley’s bidding by locking out a foreign competitor while giving its American counterparts a pass for virtually the same offenses.\n\nYet, after last week, we’re closer to doing that bidding than ever. Dozens of House members insisted that TikTok posed an imminent threat, and they spent nearly all of their time issuing statements in support of that. We learned little about TikTok’s true risks.\n\nI think a ban still isn’t the most likely outcome. It seems likely that Congress and the Biden administration are floating the most extreme possibility to bargain ByteDance into a sale, and the RESTRICT Act that sets the stage for banning TikTok also includes several other possible remedies that fall short of a ban. But particularly in the short term, actually banning TikTok seems like a very real possibility. That would put the US in the company of a handful of countries that have nixed TikTok access for the public at large — primarily India, whose government also has a penchant for raiding social networking companies that fact-check politicians and imposing draconian internet blackouts.\n\nThe best defense I’ve read of the TikTok ban comes from former Obama official Tim Wu, who simply acknowledged that it’s mainly about punishing the Chinese government and diminishing its global influence. Here’s the heart of Wu’s claim:\n\n\u003e Were almost any country other than China involved, Mr. Trump’s demands would be indefensible. But the threatened bans on TikTok and WeChat, whatever their motivations, can also be seen as an overdue response, a tit for tat, in a long battle for the soul of the internet.\n\u003e In China, the foreign equivalents of TikTok and WeChat — video and messaging apps such as YouTube and WhatsApp — have been banned for years. The country’s extensive blocking, censorship and surveillance violate just about every principle of internet openness and decency. China keeps a closed and censorial internet economy at home while its products enjoy full access to open markets abroad.\n\u003e The asymmetry is unfair and ought no longer be tolerated. The privilege of full internet access — the open internet — should be extended only to companies from countries that respect that openness themselves.\n\u003e [...]\n\u003e Some think that it is a tragic mistake for the United States to violate the principles of internet openness that were pioneered in this country. But there is also such a thing as being a sucker. If China refuses to follow the rules of the open internet, why continue to give it access to internet markets around the world?\n\nThis is honest, unvarnished, and compelling. It is also, again, weird. “Principles are for suckers” is not the kind of argument you make lightly. I have great respect for Wu, and I fully believe he’s considered the ramifications of it — but I don’t believe for a minute that some members of Congress, who have spent years introducing knee-jerk legislation specific to the latest tech scandal while dragging their feet on protecting basic rights like privacy, have done so.\n\nThe implication in some quarters is that we’re in a cold war with China, but if so, why make information its first casualty? Let’s be clear: America has imposed a lot of terribly punitive sanctions around the world that hit speech as part of broad trade embargoes, including ones that amount to banning citizens of other nations from accessing web platforms. But right now, we’re moving toward a future where you can import nearly any type of good from China but speech, based on fears that seem more like cover for a realpolitik containment strategy.\n\nAs Knight First Amendment Institute executive director Jameel Jaffer notes, the First Amendment includes a right for citizens to receive information — even, in fact, foreign propaganda. And banning TikTok would affect not only speech from TikTok but also the speech of users on the platform, who could see their videos made inaccessible. A judge blocked former President Donald Trump’s attempt to ban Chinese app WeChat on those very grounds in 2020, acknowledging the ban solved mostly hypothetical concerns and raised “serious” First Amendment questions for users.\n\n\"Things didn’t have to be this way\"\n\nLook, holding to idealistic principles is hard. It requires constant second-guessing that maybe you are just being a sucker, and I can’t rule out the idea that banning TikTok would in some way make America safer from foreign threats. (While I’m emphatically not equating the overall US political system to China’s, the American intelligence community has done a large amount of spying through domestic companies.) But people have made the same argument to justify everything from outlawing encryption to jailing whistleblowers. If it’s time to abandon the idea that Americans should be allowed to access information from around the world on their own terms — including information that might be bad for them — I haven’t seen the evidence yet to justify it.\n\nAnd the most frustrating part of all is that things didn’t have to be this way. The biggest reason TikTok can’t prove your data is secure is that we live with a web built around opaque walled gardens — one where we’re all putting huge amounts of trust in a few companies that probably don’t deserve it.\n\nThere’s a world, by contrast, where services like TikTok are built around interoperability. You could choose where your data is stored, and the app could get access to what you intentionally disclosed, like your viewing history and the videos you’ve posted. While you engaged with tools like AI-generated filters or the recommendation algorithm, things like your location and keystroke data could stay on your phone or with a host of your choosing. And in a worst-case scenario where a TikTok ban did happen, you wouldn’t lose access to every video you’ve ever made or watched. If TikTok refused to allow that kind of interoperability, there’d be a more morally consistent argument for cracking down on it. It wouldn’t solve every potential critique of the service, but it’s far better than what we’ve got now.\n\nThere’s ample room for Congress to push for a more interconnected, more private, and more secure internet — and then let TikTok choose whether to engage fairly. Instead, America is on the verge of deciding that the only way to beat China is to join it.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"The Vergecast watched the TikTok hearing so you don’t have to.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-03-25T15:28:58.707Z","dateModified":"2023-03-25T15:28:58.707Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/25/23656272/the-vergecast-watched-the-tiktok-hearing-so-you-dont-have-to","author":[],"articleBody":"And we bring you the best parts, including Grapefruit Theories and WiFi Problems and The One About The Eyes.

In the packet, there appeared to be a sheet matching the names and faces of the lawmakers preparing to question him — many of whom had already made up their minds over whether the app was safe for Americans.\n\n“Your platform should be banned,” Chair Cathy McMorris-Rodgers (R-WA) said in her opening statement Thursday. “I expect today you’ll say anything to avoid this outcome.”\n\nFor more than three years, TikTok has been operating under the looming threat of a nationwide ban. But what was once a GOP-led campaign admonishing the popular video-sharing app as a threat to national security has now evolved into a government-wide, bipartisan effort to ban it outright.\n\nOver the last few months alone, Republicans and Democrats have rallied behind legislation barring TikTok from operating in the US. Intelligence officials have called the app “a tool” of the Chinese government, and the Biden administration has reportedly backed the company into a corner. If TikTok doesn’t agree to find an American replacement for its Beijing-based owner, ByteDance, it will be banned. \n\n\"“Your platform should be banned ... I expect today you’ll say anything to avoid this outcome.”\"\n\nBut at this point, there has been little evidence in support of the accusations haunting the company. In a promise to lawmakers Thursday, Chew said, “TikTok has never shared, or received a request to share, US user data with the Chinese government. Nor would TikTok honor such a request if one were ever made.”\n\nTo Chew, the concerns raised over TikTok’s alleged relationship with the Chinese government rely more on speculation than fact. “I think a lot of risks that are pointed out are hypothetical and theoretical risks,” he said. “I have not seen any evidence. I am eagerly awaiting discussions where we can talk about evidence, and then we can address the concerns that are being raised.”\n\nFew members of Congress seemed sympathetic to that argument, though — and it’s the potential for future abuse by foreign actors that has seemingly scared lawmakers most. Congress has been caught on its back foot before, introducing data protection bills in the aftermath of American-made social media scandals, like the Wall Street Journal’s reporting on the Facebook Files. \n\n\"“With a lot of respect, American social companies don’t have a good track record with data privacy and user security.”\"\n\n“These tools are very, very powerful,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told The Verge on Wednesday, describing how social media can be used to enable foreign influence operations. “I’m not saying that they’re doing it right now. But why would we wait until President Xi and China says, ‘I’m ready to pull the trigger and invade Taiwan’?”\n\nEarlier this month, Warner introduced the RESTRICT Act, a bipartisan-backed bill that would authorize the Secretary of Commerce with the power to investigate and ban the use of technologies derived from adversarial countries. At least 18 senators spanning both parties and the Biden administration have come out in support of the bill.\n\nStill, there’s a growing coalition of House Democrats opposing legislation that could ban TikTok. Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) held a press conference with around 30 TikTok influencers opposing a federal ban. It was one of the first times any lawmaker had come out so publicly in TikTok’s favor. Surrounded by activist signs calling for Congress to #KeepTikTok, Bowman attributed much of the app’s criticism to xenophobia. \n\n“Usually, if there’s a matter of national security concern, they hold a bipartisan Congressional briefing on that particular issue,” Bowman said Wednesday. “We have not received a bipartisan Congressional briefing on the national security risk of TikTok.”\n\nEven without overwhelming evidence of its potential to harm national security, TikTok’s reputation is not spotless. A number of reports have detailed instances in which ByteDance workers wrongfully accessed American user data, including the IP addresses of American journalists. TikTok admitted to the latter scandal, claiming that the employees “misused their authority.”\n\nBut it was not lost on Chew that American companies have made similar mistakes in the past. “With a lot of respect, American social companies don’t have a good track record with data privacy and user security,” Chew said. “Just look at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, for one example.”\n\nIn Cambridge Analytica’s case, Facebook settled with the Federal Trade Commission for $5 billion.

Now, with more than 150 million American users, the threats have escalated into legislation and an ultimatum from the Biden administration. Thursday’s hearing with the GOP-led House Committee on Energy and Commerce could be Chew and TikTok’s last shot at convincing lawmakers that the app is safe.\n\n“TikTok has never shared, or received a request to share, U.S. user data with the Chinese government. Nor would TikTok honor such a request if one were ever made,” Chew wrote in his opening statement. “Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country.” Like other hearings, you’ll be able to stream the TikTok questioning at 10AM ET on the Energy and Commerce Committee website, where you’ll find Chew’s testimony as well.\n\nTikTok is facing criticism across the political spectrum, with both Republicans and Democrats warning it’s a national security threat. The company, a subsidiary of Chinese titan ByteDance, has tried to reassure legislators that it’s walled off from foreign political influence. That particularly includes demands to hand over American user data to the Chinese government. So far, there’s little hard evidence it’s doing so — but also few ways for TikTok to prove it couldn’t happen given the government’s tight rein over tech companies inside the country. The same goes for complaints that China might harness TikTok’s recommendation system to push propaganda.\n\n\"“TikTok’s lack of transparency, repeated obfuscations, and misstatements of fact have severely undermined the credibility of any statements by TikTok employees.”\"\n\nAnd it does look like TikTok has made dubious individual decisions. Last week, we learned the Department of Justice was investigating allegations that TikTok spied on journalists with its app — something that American tech companies have allegedly done, too, but that certainly doesn’t help its case. Previous reports indicate TikTok has suppressed controversial political topics that include references to Tiananmen Square, although it’s said it retired those guidelines well before the current push to ban it. In general, TikTok faces many of the same criticisms other tech social networks do, from disinformation to pushing harmful material to minors. The difference is that TikTok can be targeted by sanctions in a way that, say, the California-based Meta can’t.\n\nSo it’s not clear TikTok will be able to do much to placate members of Congress. “While I appreciate Mr. Chew’s willingness to answer questions before Congress, TikTok’s lack of transparency, repeated obfuscations, and misstatements of fact have severely undermined the credibility of any statements by TikTok employees, including Mr. Chew,” Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) said in a statement Wednesday. For today’s hearing, in particular, we’re expecting a lot of grandstanding for the cameras, rather than questions that will reveal much about TikTok’s operations.\n\nA TikTok ban was once almost entirely on the table among Republicans — then-president Donald Trump issued one in 2020, although his administration decisively failed to make it happen. But in the past few months, President Joe Biden and other Democrats have taken aim at the app, too, despite its efforts to placate politicians with a plan called Project Texas, which would involve moving all of its user data to the US under the eye of American company Oracle. The rhetoric against it intensified after the discovery of possible Chinese spy balloons strained US-China relations, and at this point, Biden is reportedly demanding ByteDance sell the app or face a ban.\n\nIn spite of this, the company has some defenders. Hours before Thursday’s hearing, a group of Democratic lawmakers, led by Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY), held a press conference with more than two dozen TikTok creators in support of TikTok. It was one of the first times lawmakers came out opposing a ban, touting the app’s benefits for small businesses and content creators.\n\nRather than banning TikTok, Bowman and the creators, who were flown in by TikTok, demanded Congress focus on passing comprehensive data privacy legislation. \n\n“You can ban TikTok but there are still data brokers that sell our data to other countries and businesses in other countries. They sell to the highest bidder,” Bowman said outside the Capitol Wednesday. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"TikTok CEO appears on TikTok to warn users about the TikTok ban","alternativeHeadline":"Shou Zi Chew will appear before Congress to defend the app on March 23rd.","datePublished":"2023-03-21T15:48:50.335Z","dateModified":"2023-03-21T15:48:50.335Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23650054/tiktok-ceo-shou-zi-chew-video-warn-congress-ban-hearing","author":[],"articleBody":"TikTok is rolling out a charm offensive ahead of Thursday’s congressional hearing, putting CEO Shou Zi Chew in users’ feeds to warn them about a looming ban. Chew posted a minute-long video to the ByteDance subsidiary’s official TikTok account, rallying users to defend the app.\n\nChew’s video outlines points he’ll probably hit in his House Energy and Commerce Committee testimony later this week, where legislators will question whether the app’s Chinese ownership makes it untrustworthy. That includes the news that TikTok now has 150 million American users — something news outlets recently reported based on advance information about his testimony. “That’s almost half of the US coming to TikTok,” he observes, noting the number includes 5 million US businesses. “The majority of these are small and medium businesses.”\n\n[Media: https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/7212953186724842795]\n\nWe also learn that TikTok has 7,000 American employees, which is less than the 10,000 or more that TikTok aimed for in 2020 but a big leap over the 1,400 US headcount that year.\n\nBut on to the bad news. “Some politicians have started talking about banning TikTok,” Chew says. While it’s a slightly odd assessment given that the “starting” happened almost three years ago and the “talking about” was signing an executive order issuing a ban, it’s true that the issue has morphed from a nebulous Donald Trump demand to a mainstream political position in the past few months. “Now this could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you.” Chew doesn’t do anything as gauche as call for users to participate in the democratic process by contacting their local congressperson, but he does ask them to “let me know in the comments what you want your elected representatives to know about what you love about TikTok.” The top comment so far: “You know something went wrong when the boss has to show up.”\n\n\"“Some politicians have started talking about banning TikTok.”\"\n\nDirect-to-user lobbying is nothing new for the tech industry — Google, Reddit, Uber, and Lyft have all engaged in it. But TikTok has kept a relatively low profile and focused on buttoned-down campaigns to convince politicians and reporters of its safety. This week, it garnered headlines for changing its safety policies and its approach to AI after news broke that it’s being investigated by the Justice Department for allegedly surveilling journalists. It’s also apparently sending influencers to Washington, DC, to defend the app.\n\nA ban is almost certainly not the preferred option for many politicians. President Joe Biden’s administration has reportedly asked ByteDance to sell or spin off the company and sever its links to China — something that would assuage fears about TikTok spying on journalists, abusing users’ personal data, and secretly providing tracking data to government intelligence agencies since these are definitely not problems for US tech companies that Congress has not dragged its feet for years on fixing. It’s likely TikTok would oppose any ban in court, which users of the China-based WeChat did fairly successfully back in 2020.\n\nBut it’s not surprising Chew is finally pointing out an obvious fact: locking TikTok out of the US would be a nearly unprecedented move that huge numbers of Americans would notice, and TikTok is betting they won’t like it.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"TikTok now has 150 million monthly active users in the US.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-03-20T21:00:01.925Z","dateModified":"2023-03-20T21:00:01.925Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/20/23649135/tiktok-now-has-150-million-monthly-active-users-in-the-us","author":[],"articleBody":"The company confirmed the new stat to Reuters, and it’s a number that’s up from 100 million in 2020.

Mark Warner (D-VA), would empower the secretary of commerce to ban foreign technologies and companies from operating in the US if they present a threat to national security. While TikTok is not explicitly named in the bill text, the measure covers companies in adversarial countries including China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Venezuela.  \n\n“Today, the threat that everyone is talking about is TikTok, and how it could enable surveillance by the Chinese Communist Party, or facilitate the spread of malign influence campaigns in the U.S. Before TikTok, however, it was Huawei and ZTE, which threatened our nation’s telecommunications networks,” Warner said in a statement Tuesday. “We need a comprehensive, risk-based approach that proactively tackles sources of potentially dangerous technology before they gain a foothold in America, so we aren’t playing Whac-A-Mole and scrambling to catch up once they’re already ubiquitous.”\n\n\"The bill comes just after a separate proposal that singled out TikTok\"\n\nThe bill creates a formal process for government agencies to “deter, disrupt, prevent, prohibit, investigate, or otherwise mitigate” services they deem threatening, as long as they have access to “sensitive personal data” from more than 1 million US persons. That could potentially mean forcing American companies — including app store operators like Apple and Google — to cut off relations with TikTok or similar entities. The bill also provides the secretary of commerce with a handful of lesser tools to mitigate risky transactions, like the ability to force companies to divest services. \n\nThe Warner bill comes just a few days after the House Foreign Affairs Committee pushed through a separate measure to restrict access to TikTok. The Deterring America’s Technological Adversaries Act, or DATA Act, would direct President Joe Biden to sanction or ban TikTok if the administration determined it shared US user data with individuals associated with the Chinese government. \n\nUnlike the House bill, Warner’s Senate measure would create a framework for evaluating and punishing foreign companies that pose a risk to US security, rather than simply targeting TikTok as a company.\n\n“We shouldn’t let any company subject to the Chinese Communist Party’s dictates collect data on a third of our population – and while TikTok is just the latest example, it won’t be the last,” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Tuesday. “The federal government can’t continue to address new foreign technology from adversarial nations in a one-off manner; we need a strategic, enduring mechanism to protect Americans and our national security.”\n\nResponding to the Warner bill, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter argued that the measure was unnecessary. “The Biden Administration does not need additional authority from Congress to address national security concerns about TikTok: it can approve the deal negotiated with CFIUS over two years that it has spent the last six months reviewing,” Oberwetter said in a statement to The Verge on Tuesday. \n\n\"TikTok has proposed walling off most of its US operations from ByteDance\"\n\nTikTok has repeatedly denied that it stores US user data in China, a primary fear of federal officials. Despite these claims and promises to limit safety risks, the company has been stuck in negotiations with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to stay operational in the US for more than three years. \n\nOn Monday, a TikTok official presented a keynote detailing Project Texas, the company’s most substantial effort to mitigate foreign threats to US data. The proposal would wall off most of TikTok’s US operations from ByteDance, its Chinese parent company. Larry Ellison’s Oracle would play a role in auditing American data flows. \n\n“We appreciate that some members of Congress remain willing [to] explore options for addressing national security concerns that don’t have the effect of censoring millions of Americans. A U.S. ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide,” Oberwetter said.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to appear before Congress for a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing later this month.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"A GOP plan to ban TikTok nationwide advances out of committee","alternativeHeadline":"The bill would allow President Joe Biden to ban TikTok for sharing user data with the Chinese government.","datePublished":"2023-03-01T19:06:23.990Z","dateModified":"2023-03-01T19:06:23.990Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/1/23620736/tiktok-ban-china-app-biden-foreign-affairs-bytedance","author":[],"articleBody":"Republicans on a powerful House committee voted to advance a bill on Wednesday that would allow President Joe Biden to ban TikTok from the United States, despite objections from Democrats and civil liberty groups. \n\nIn a 24-16 vote, the House Foreign Affairs Committee greenlit Rep. Michael McCaul’s (R-TX) Deterring America’s Technological Adversaries Act, or DATA Act, sending it to the House floor. The bill directs Biden to sanction, or possibly ban, TikTok nationwide if the administration finds that the company shared user data with individuals associated with the Chinese government. If that data was used to surveil, hack, or censor users, Biden could impose additional sanctions against TikTok and its parent-company Bytedance.\n\n“TikTok is a modern day Trojan horse of the CCP used to surveil and exploit Americans’ personal information,” McCaul said in a markup of the bill Tuesday.\n\nWhile there are bipartisan concerns over TikTok’s potential risks to national security, Democrats fear that McCaul’s solution, which was introduced last Friday, is even riskier. The committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), called the bill “dangerously overbroad” and argued its passage could affect businesses located in ally countries in Europe and Taiwan.\n\n\"“Congress must not censor entire platforms and strip Americans of their constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression”\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union echoed these concerns in a letter to McCaul on Monday, saying that the bill poses a threat to the First Amendment. \n\n“Congress must not censor entire platforms and strip Americans of their constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression. Whether we’re discussing the news of the day, live streaming protests, or ​​even watching cat videos, we have a right to use TikTok and other platforms to exchange our thoughts, ideas, and opinions with people around the country and around the world,” Jenna Leventoff, ACLU senior policy counsel, said in a Tuesday statement. \n\nResponding to the committee’s vote, TikTok issued a statement saying that banning the app would effectively place “a ban on the export of American culture and values” to the company’s international audience.\n\n“We’re disappointed to see this rushed piece of legislation move forward, despite its considerable negative impact on the free speech rights of millions of Americans who use and love TikTok,” the company said. \n\nShortly after Wednesday’s vote, McCaul told Reuters that he expects the bill to be taken up for a floor vote this month. But before the bill makes its way to Biden, the Democrat-controlled Senate would also need to approve it. \n\nThe vote comes weeks before TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is scheduled to appear before the Energy and Commerce Committee on March 23rd to answer questions related to the app’s relationship with the Chinese government.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Now the European Commission is banning TikTok from staffers’ phones, too.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-02-23T13:48:20.173Z","dateModified":"2023-02-23T13:48:20.173Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/23/23611723/now-the-european-commission-is-banning-tiktok-from-staffers-phones-too","author":[],"articleBody":"The EU Commission is instructing employees to delete TikTok from the devices they use to access the agency’s apps and emails over concerns about cybersecurity, according to a report from The Guardian.\n\nSeveral US states have already introduced bans on the app on government phones, while the House of Representatives banned TikTok from staff members’ mobile devices last December.\n\n[Attachment: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/23/european-commission-bans-staff-from-using-tiktok-on-work-devices]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Here’s a video of TikTok’s new transparency center.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-02-03T23:48:01.412Z","dateModified":"2023-02-03T23:48:01.412Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/3/23585276/heres-a-video-of-tiktoks-new-transparency-center","author":[],"articleBody":"The Washington Post’s Taylor Lorenz shared an Instagram video of the recent media tour of the center.

It has already been prohibited on federal employee devices, blocked by dozens of universities across the country, and lawmakers are calling for its removal from US app stores.\n\nIt’s with that context that I and a handful of other journalists were invited to the company’s Los Angeles headquarters earlier this week for the first media tour of its “Transparency and Accountability Center.” It’s a space that, like the political discussion about TikTok these days, seems more about virtue signaling than anything else. Company officials say the center is designed for regulators, academics, and auditors to learn more about how the app works and its security practices. We were told that a politician-who-would-not-be-named had toured it the day before. TikTok eventually plans to open more centers in Washington, DC, Dublin, and Singapore.\n\nOur tour was part of a multi-week press blitz by TikTok to push Project Texas, a novel proposal to the US government that would partition off American user data in lieu of a complete ban. The CEO of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, was in DC last week giving a similar pitch to policymakers and think tanks. In March, he is expected to testify before ​​Congress for the first time.\n\n[Image: What you see when you first enter TikTok’s transparency center. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Po_A2kso1HSwKXyOO-607FGekLw=/0x0:3060x2040/3060x2040/filters:focal(1530x1020:1531x1021)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24401452/236514_Tiktok_transparency_center_AZaucha_0001.jpg]\n\nTikTok isn’t the first embattled tech company to lean on the spectacle of a physical space during a PR crisis. In 2018, Facebook invited journalists to tour its election “War Room,” which was really just a glorified conference room packed with employees staring at social media feeds and dashboards. Photos were taken, stories were written, and then the War Room was closed about a month later.\n\nIn a similar way, TikTok’s transparency center is a lot of smoke and mirrors designed to give the impression that it really cares. Large touchscreens explain how TikTok works at a high level, along with a broad overview of the kind of trust and safety efforts that have become table stakes for any large platform.\n\nA key difference, however, is a room my tour group wasn’t allowed to enter. Behind a wall with Death Star-like mood lighting, TikTok officials said a server room houses the app’s source code for outside auditors to review. Anyone who enters is required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, go through metal detectors, and lock away their phone in a storage locker. (It wasn’t clear who exactly would be permitted to enter the room.)\n\n[Image: A room where you can interact with a mock version of the moderation software TikTok uses. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwHbpDhUnqdXXhd1CZGJ6L4VoQU=/0x0:3060x2040/3060x2040/filters:focal(1530x1020:1531x1021)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24401465/236514_Tiktok_transparency_center_AZaucha_0014.jpg]\n\nThe interactive part of the center I was allowed to experience included a room with iMacs running a mock version of the software TikTok says its moderators use to review content. There was another room with iMacs running “code simulators.” While that sounded intriguing, it was really just a basic explanation of TikTok’s algorithm that seemed designed for a typical member of Congress to grasp. Close-up photos of the computer screens weren’t allowed. And despite it being called a transparency center, TikTok’s PR department made everyone agree to not quote or directly attribute comments made by employees leading the tour.\n\nAt the moderator workstation, I was shown some potentially violating videos to review, along with basic information like the accounts that posted them and each video’s number of likes and reshares. When I pulled up one of a man talking into the camera with the caption of “the world bringing up 9/11 to justify Muslims as t3rrori$ts,” the moderator system asked me to select whether it violated one of three policies, including one on “threats and incitement to violence.”\n\nAt the code simulator iMac in the other room, I was hoping to learn more about how TikTok’s recommendations system actually works. This was, after all, a physical place you had to travel to. Surely there would be some kind of information I couldn’t find anywhere else?\n\nWhat I got was this: TikTok starts by using a “coarse machine learning model” to select “a subset of a few thousand videos” from the billions hosted by the app. Then, a “medium machine learning model further narrows the recall pool to a smaller pool of videos” it thinks you’ll be interested in. Lastly, a “fine machine learning model” makes the final pass before serving up videos it thinks you will like in your For You page. \n\nThe information displayed was frustratingly vague. One slide read that TikTok “recommends content by ranking videos based on a combination of factors, including the interests that new users convey to TikTok the first time they interact with the app, as well as changing preferences over time.” That’s exactly how you would expect it to work.\n\n[Image: Eric Han, head of USDS Trust and Safety at TikTok. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JwS0iW8hn5sYqZt3Pf9O2WUj94w=/0x0:3060x2040/3060x2040/filters:focal(1530x1020:1531x1021)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24401472/236514_Tiktok_transparency_center_AZaucha_0021.jpg]\n\nTikTok first tried to open this transparency center in 2020, when then-President Donald Trump was trying to ban the app and Kevin Mayer was its CEO for all of three months. But then the pandemic happened, delaying the center’s opening until now.\n\nIn the past three years, TikTok’s trust deficit in DC has only deepened, fueled by a growing anti-China sentiment that started on the right and has since become more bipartisan. The worst revelation was in late December, when the company confirmed that employees improperly accessed the location data of several US journalists as part of an internal leak investigation. That same month, FBI director Chris Wray warned that China could use TikTok to “manipulate content, and if they want to, to use it for influence operations.”\n\nTikTok’s answer to these concerns is Project Texas, a highly technical, unprecedented plan that would wall off most of TikTok’s US operations from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. To make Project Texas a reality, TikTok is relying on Oracle, whose billionaire founder Larry Ellison leveraged his connections as an influential Republican donor to personally secure Trump’s blessing in the early phase of negotiations. (No one from Oracle was present at the briefing I attended, and my request to speak with someone there for this story wasn’t answered.)\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yk3JKsB-R-w5HlxGN0fYAvXEOVc=/0x0:3060x2040/3060x2040/filters:focal(1530x1020:1531x1021)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24401464/236514_Tiktok_transparency_center_AZaucha_0013.jpg]\n\nI was given a brief overview of Project Texas before the tour, though I was asked to not quote the employees who presented directly. One graphic I was shown featured a Supreme Court-like building with five pillars showing the issues Project Texas is meant to address: org design, data protection and access control, tech assurance, content assurance, and compliance and monitoring.\n\nTikTok says it has already taken thousands of people and over $1.5 billion to create Project Texas. The effort involves TikTok creating a separate legal entity dubbed USDS with an independent board from ByteDance that reports directly to the US government. More than seven outside auditors, including Oracle, will review all data that flows in and out of the US version of TikTok. Only American user data will be available to train the algorithm in the US, and TikTok says there will be strict compliance requirements for any internal access to US data. If the proposal is approved by the government, it will cost TikTok an estimated $700 million to $1 billion per year to maintain. \n\nWhether Project Texas satisfies the government or not, it certainly seems like it will make working at TikTok more difficult. The US version of TikTok will have to be fully deconstructed, rebuilt, and published by Oracle to US app stores. Oracle will also have to review every app update. Duplicate roles will be created for TikTok in the US, even if the same roles already exist for TikTok elsewhere. And app performance could suffer when Americans are interacting with users and content in other countries since American user data has to be managed inside the country.\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uq9xMkzHsK2mK883pPmWJ7jZgBI=/0x0:3060x2040/3060x2040/filters:focal(1530x1020:1531x1021)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24401453/236514_Tiktok_transparency_center_AZaucha_0002.jpg]\n\nOne name that wasn’t uttered during the entire briefing: ByteDance. I got the impression that TikTok employees felt uncomfortable talking about their relationship with their parent company. \n\nWhile ByteDance was directly unacknowledged, its ties to TikTok weren’t hidden, either. The Wi-Fi for the building I was in was named ByteDance and conference room screens in the transparency center displayed Lark, the in-house communications tool ByteDance developed for its employees around the world. At one point during the tour, I tried asking what would hypothetically happen if, once Project Texas is greenlit, a Bytedance employee in China makes an uncomfortable request to an employee in TikTok’s US entity. I was quickly told by a member of TikTok’s PR team that the question wasn’t appropriate for the tour.\n\nUltimately, I was left with the feeling that, like its powerful algorithm, TikTok built its transparency center to show people what it thinks they want to see. The company seems to have realized that it won’t save itself from a US ban on the technical merits of its Project Texas proposal. The debate is now purely a matter of politics and optics. Unlike the tour I went on, that’s something TikTok can’t control.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Apple and Google face mounting pressure to remove TikTok from app stores","alternativeHeadline":"Sen.

Michael Bennet (D-CO) demanded that Apple and Google “immediately” remove TikTok from their app stores in a letter addressed to the companies’ chief executives, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, Thursday. \n\nBennet’s push to restrict downloads of the app is just the latest in a series of mounting congressional actions to ban the embattled Chinese-owned app. Since January, Republicans and Democrats have been calling for either their colleagues or Biden administration officials to quickly impose stricter data collection restrictions or a nationwide ban on the app, citing its possible risks to US national security. \n\n“TikTok’s vast influence and aggressive data collection pose a specific threat to US national security because of its parent company’s obligations under Chinese law,” Bennet wrote. “Given these grave and growing concerns, I ask that you remove TikTok from your respective app stores immediately.”\n\n\"“TikTok’s vast influence and aggressive data collection pose a specific threat to US national security because of its parent company’s obligations under Chinese law.”\"\n\nBennet, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is the first lawmaker to reach out directly to app store providers like Apple and Google requesting TikTok’s removal. \n\nFor more than three years, TikTok has been stuck in negotiations with the federal government, primarily the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), to keep operating its app in the US. Since the Trump administration, TikTok has faced mounting scrutiny from lawmakers who fear the app may share US user data with the Chinese government. \n\nIn a rare public interview at last year’s New York Times DealBook summit, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew described “Project Texas,” the company’s plan to move all data from Virginia and Singapore to US-based Oracle servers overseen by a new subsidiary known as TikTok US Data Security Inc.\n\nDespite these initiatives, momentum to ban the app has only grown following revelations that ByteDance employees have repeatedly accessed the data of US users over the last few years. \n\nAs recently as December, Forbes reported that ByteDance employees inappropriately obtained data collected from US users. At least two reporters had their data viewed by ByteDance employees who were investigating past leaks of internal company documents. ByteDance confirmed the reporting and said it had fired all four employees who participated in the scheme, two of whom worked in China.\n\nTikTok and CFIUS have yet to strike a deal to keep the app operational in the US. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that talks between the two parties had stalled, delaying any expected deal. \n\nWith TikTok’s future still unknown, lawmakers have started pursuing their own solutions. Earlier this week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced that Chew would appear at a March hearing focused on US user safety and security. \n\n“Big Tech has increasingly become a destructive force in American Society,” chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said in a statement Monday. “Bytedance-owned TikTok has knowingly allowed the ability for the Chinese Communist Party to access American user data.”\n\nResponding to Monday’s hearing announcement, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter welcomed “the opportunity to set the record straight.” Oberwetter said TikTok plans to discuss its “comprehensive plans” to protect US user safety during the March 23rd hearing. \n\nUnlike Google, Apple has a lot to lose regarding its relationship with both the US and China. Much of Cook’s success at Apple can be attributed to his ability to maintain working relationships with the Chinese government and manufacturers. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"TikTok CEO to testify before Congress in March","alternativeHeadline":"Lawmakers are expected to grill the company over its potential risk to US national security.","datePublished":"2023-01-30T16:35:46.567Z","dateModified":"2023-01-30T16:35:46.567Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/30/23577870/tiktok-ceo-testify-congress-bytedance-energy-commerce-shou-zi-chew","author":[],"articleBody":"TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to appear before Congress in March to face questions from lawmakers over US user safety and security on the popular video app, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. \n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee confirmed the hearing in a press release Monday announcing that the TikTok chief would testify on March 23rd. TikTok chief operating officer Vanessa Pappas has testified before a congressional committee as recently as last September, but this upcoming hearing will be the first time a chief executive of the company has been hauled to Capitol Hill to face questioning.\n\n\"“ByteDance-owned TikTok has knowingly allowed the ability for the Chinese Communist Party to access American user data.”\"\n\n“Big Tech has increasingly become a destructive force in American society. The Energy and Commerce Committee has been at the forefront of asking Big Tech CEOs — from Facebook to Twitter to Google — to answer for their companies’ actions,” Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said in a statement Monday. “These efforts will continue with TikTok. ByteDance-owned TikTok has knowingly allowed the ability for the Chinese Communist Party to access American user data.”\n\nReached for comment, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter told The Verge Monday that the company welcomes “the opportunity to set the record straight about TikTok, ByteDance, and the commitments we are making to address concerns about U.S. national security before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.” Oberwetter continued, “We hope that by sharing details of our comprehensive plans with the full Committee, Congress can take a more deliberative approach to the issues at hand.”\n\nThe announcement comes weeks after Republicans officially took over as the majority party in the House. They’ve wasted little time ramping up scrutiny of the Chinese-owned app that touts over 80 million monthly active users in the US, citing its potential risk to national security. \n\nTikTok has been stuck in yearslong negotiations with the Committee on Foreign Investment to keep its app running in the US. But in December, The Wall Street Journal reported that talks between the app and government officials had stalled, delaying any possible deal. \n\nResponding to Chair Rodgers’s security claims, Oberwetter said Monday, “The Chinese Communist Party has neither direct nor indirect control of ByteDance or TikTok. Moreover, under the proposal we have devised with our country’s top national security agencies through CFIUS, that kind of data sharing—or any other form of foreign influence over the TikTok platform in the United States—would not be possible.”\n\nIf the government can’t strike a deal with TikTok over the next few months, lawmakers may prepare solutions of their own. TikTok’s growing dominance in the tech space has long been a bipartisan issue that could force Republicans and Democrats to work together over the next two years to resolve through legislation. As recently as last week, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) signed onto legislation introduced by China hawk Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) that would effectively ban TikTok nationwide. \n\nEarlier this month, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was reportedly considering offering a bill to ban a broader “category of applications” that could be applied to other apps that pose security risks, according to Axios.\n\nA growing number of states and federal agencies have banned downloads of TikTok on government devices over the last few months, but Congress has yet to reach an agreement on any ban that would affect consumers. But recent reporting that TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, tracked US journalists’ locations with data from the app has provided lawmakers fresh ammo in targeting the company.\n\n“Americans deserve to know how these actions impact their privacy and data security, as well as what actions TikTok is taking to keep our kids safe from online and offline harms,” Rodgers said in a statement Monday. “We’ve made our concerns clear with TikTok. It is now time to continue the committee’s efforts to hold Big Tech accountable by bringing TikTok before the committee to provide complete and honest answers for people.”\n\nUPDATED January 30th, 2023 at 11:55 PM ET: Added a statement from TikTok responding to the hearing announcement.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Why TikTok’s future has never been so cloudy","alternativeHeadline":"ByteDance thought it had a deal with the government in August.

The video-centric social app currently ranks No. 3 overall in both stores, trailing only a shopping app and mood diary (on Android) and a to-do app and video editor (on iOS). That video editing app is CapCut, by the way, and it is also developed by ByteDance; CapCut is an app for making TikTok videos.\n\nDownloads are a crude metric for capturing an app’s cultural impact, but there’s no doubt that TikTok has retained its dominant position among social apps as the year begins. It’s the place where new trends are born, pop stars are minted, and young people spend a staggering share of their time.\n\nBut while American teenagers spent their holiday break installing TikTok on their brand-new iPhones, US government officials were taking a much more skeptical view of the app and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A movement to ban the app that began with Republican state governors quickly spread to Congress, and now TikTok is forbidden from being installed on devices owned by the federal government.\n\nAccording to Reuters, 19 of the 50 states now restrict access to TikTok on government computers, with most of the bans being passed during a two-week period last month. That’s in addition to school districts and other parts of the public sector, which have introduced restrictions of their own.\n\nHere’s Paresh Dave at Reuters:\n\n\u003e Jamf Holding Corp., which sells software to organizations to enable filtering and security measures on iPhones and other Apple devices, said its government customers have increasingly blocked access to TikTok since the middle of this year.\n\u003e About 65% of attempted connections to TikTok have been blocked this month on devices managed by Jamf’s public sector customers worldwide, including school districts and various other agencies, up from 10% of connections being blocked in June, the company said.\n\nIn some cases, these are largely symbolic protests: relatively few state agencies were maintaining significant presences on TikTok, and motivated hackers would likely have easier and more useful ways to surveil government targets than by accessing their TikTok data.\n\nBut amid an ongoing trade war with China, distrust of ByteDance is the rare tech issue on which Republicans and Democrats found bipartisan agreement. The $1.7 trillion spending bill that President Biden signed into law on Thursday contained a provision banning TikTok from devices under federal management; it is also banned in the House of Representatives and the Senate. \n\nAll of which raises a question that had seemed mostly resolved since Trump left office: could TikTok be banned in the United States, period?\n\n\"Biden is proving to be quite hawkish on Chinese tech\"\n\nTrump tried and failed to forcibly divest ByteDance of TikTok and hand it to one of his top fundraisers, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. Biden has taken a less thuggish approach to his China dealings, but in the end is proving to be quite hawkish on Chinese tech: he has worked to prevent China from developing advanced chips, plans to limit US investments in Chinese tech, and will restrict the ability of Chinese apps to collect data about Americans. (Guess who that last one is aimed at.)\n\nSince Biden took office, TikTok has been working to reach a deal with the Council on Foreign Investment in the United States that would let ByteDance continue to own the company while putting TikTok’s user data, recommendation algorithms, and corporate governance into a kind of quarantine.\n\nThe company shared more details about its plans just before Christmas with Reuters. Here are Echo Wang and David Shephardson:\n\n\u003e To overcome these hurdles, TikTok has sought to provide new layers of oversight to the U.S. government. It has expanded Oracle’s role to ensuring that TikTok’s technology infrastructure is separate from ByteDance, the sources said.\n\u003e Oracle will review both app codes, which determine the look and feel of TikTok, and server codes, which provide functions such as search and recommendations, according to the sources. The reviews will occur at dedicated “transparency centers” visited by Oracle engineers, with the first one scheduled to open in Maryland in January, one of the sources added.\n\u003e TikTok has also proposed to form a “proxy” board that would run the [US Data Security] division independent of ByteDance, the sources said. This division is headed on an interim basis by Andrew Bonillo, a former U.S Secret Service agent, and until a security deal with the U.S. is reached it reports to TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew.\n\nA basic template for the deal was in place by August, a TikTok spokeswoman told me today. But the Biden administration has been slow to make a decision, as different government departments and agencies disagree about how to move forward, Reuters reported.\n\nIn that respect, the story of TikTok’s future is a familiar one to anybody who has followed the past half-decade of US tech regulation. Lawmakers hold hearings and draft rules, but succumb in the end to infighting and paralysis. The only changes we ultimately see come either from regulation in Europe or competitive pressures from rivals.\n\n\"ByteDance can ill afford a high-profile mistake\"\n\nBut while that has been the story to date for Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and others, TikTok’s position appears to be much more serious. For all the criticism that Facebook in particular took during that period, it was never banned from federal government devices. And while banning TikTok for consumers would surely cause a furor, Biden’s China posture to date suggests that he may be willing to do it anyway.\n\nAt such a fraught time, ByteDance can ill afford a high-profile mistake. And yet in the days after more states began to ban TikTok, an internal investigation found that ByteDance employees had used TikTok to record journalists’ physical locations using their IP addresses. It was apparently part of a leak investigation in which ByteDance attempted to discover reporters’ sources — particularly sources for Forbes’ Emily Baker-White, who has broken a series of important stories about connections between TikTok and ByteDance over the past year.\n\nBaker-White reports:\n\n\u003e According to materials reviewed by Forbes, ByteDance tracked multiple Forbes journalists as part of this covert surveillance campaign, which was designed to unearth the source of leaks inside the company following a drumbeat of stories exposing the company’s ongoing links to China. As a result of the investigation into the surveillance tactics, ByteDance fired Chris Lepitak, its chief internal auditor who led the team responsible for them. The China-based executive Song Ye, who Lepitak reported to and who reports directly to ByteDance CEO Rubo Liang, resigned.\n\u003e “I was deeply disappointed when I was notified of the situation… and I’m sure you feel the same,” Liang wrote in an internal email shared with Forbes. “The public trust that we have spent huge efforts building is going to be significantly undermined by the misconduct of a few individuals. … I believe this situation will serve as a lesson to us all.”\n\nAs Baker-White noted, this represented a sharp reversal from October, when ByteDance tweeted that “TikTok has never been used to ‘target’ any members of the U.S. government, activists, public figures or journalists.” Analyzing TikTok reporters’ physical locations in an effort to out their sources certainly qualifies under my definition of targeting — and it met a lot of lawmakers’ definitions, too. \n\nIt’s difficult to overstate the degree to which the TikTok spying scandal has undermined the goodwill the company spent the past few years cultivating through its transparency centers, public research APIs, and similar industry-leading measures. For years, executives have openly scoffed at the idea that their app could be used to surveil Americans. But in the end it was used for exactly that purpose. And worse, it was used against the Americans working to understand the relationship between ByteDance and TikTok.\n\n“The misconduct of certain individuals, who are no longer employed at ByteDance, was an egregious misuse of their authority to obtain access to user data,” the company told me over email. “This misbehavior is unacceptable, and not in line with our efforts across TikTok to earn the trust of our users. We take data security incredibly seriously, and we will continue to enhance our access protocols, which have already been significantly improved and hardened since this incident took place.”\n\nI hope that’s true. But as the movement to ban TikTok accelerates, the company can no longer plead innocence to charges of targeted surveillance. For a handful of reporters, “TikTok is spying on you” was the rare conspiracy theory that turned out to be true. And as 2023 proceeds, that could give President Biden all the reason he needs to finish what Trump started.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"TikTok is banned on devices issued by the US House of Representatives","alternativeHeadline":"A directive from the chief administrative officer of the House claims that the popular social media app is a security risk.","datePublished":"2022-12-28T17:11:13.984Z","dateModified":"2022-12-28T17:11:13.984Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/28/23529443/tiktok-banned-house-of-representatives-bytedance-security","author":[],"articleBody":"The US House of Representatives has ordered staff to delete TikTok from any House-issued mobile phones, according to an internal memo obtained by NBC News. The directive was reportedly issued by Catherine L Szpindor, the chief administrative officer of the House, and also bans the popular social media app from being downloaded on House-issued devices going forward.\n\nThe CAO’s Office of Cybersecurity believes TikTok to be a “high risk to users” due to a lack of transparency regarding how its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, handles customer data. “House staff are NOT allowed to download the TikTok app on any House mobile devices,” the memo said. “If you have the TikTok app on your House mobile device, you will be contacted to remove it.”\n\n\"Local administrations in 19 states have already banned TikTok on government issued-devices\"\n\nBrooke Oberwetter, a spokeswoman for TikTok, said to The Wall Street Journal that the move was a political signal rather than a practical solution for security concerns, and claimed that the ban would have minimal impact because very few House-managed phones have TikTok installed.\n\nThe directive follows multiple other attempts to restrict the use of TikTok in the US over fears that the Chinese government could use the app to track and spy on people within the US. TikTok is already banned on government-owned devices by the local administrations in 19 states citing security concerns, and the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by Congress on December 23rd contains language banning the app on phones issued to employees of agencies in the executive branch, with exemptions for law enforcement, national security, and research purposes.\n\n\"TikTok is negotiating a deal with the Justice Department to resolve national security concerns\"\n\nTikTok has long denied that its handling of user data is cause for concern, alleging that US user data is not stored in China and that information isn’t shared with the Chinese government. The company promised to “meaningfully address any security concerns that have been raised at both the federal and state level” in a statement last week following Congress’s passing of the spending bill.\n\nMany members of Congress are present on TikTok, and while House lawmakers and staffers are now required to delete the app, this directive still does not apply to the Senate. Some senators like Marco Rubio (R-FL) have recently called for a nationwide ban on TikTok in the US.\n\nTikTok has its work cut out for it if it hopes to convince the US government that the platform can be trusted.

The accessed data includes the reporters’ IP addresses, which were used to see if they had been physically near TikTok employees who were suspected of leaking information to the press. \n\nIn an email to employees, the CEO of Beijing-based ByteDance, Rubo Liang, said he was “deeply disappointed” and that “the public trust that we have spent huge efforts building is going to be significantly undermined by the misconduct of a few individuals.” In another internal email, TikTok’s CEO who reports to Liang, Shou Chew, referred to the incident as “the poorly conceived acts of a few people.” And in a third email, TikTok general counsel Erich Andersen said the company’s Internet Audit and Risk team is being restructured in response. You can read all three memos in full at the bottom of this story.\n\nThe revelation comes as US lawmakers make moves to restrict TikTok over national security concerns, including banning it from government phones. It also shows ByteDance walking back denials that TikTok has never been used to “target” journalists.\n\nThe company’s investigation, which was conducted by an outside law firm, revealed that the two journalists who had their data accessed by ByteDance’s Internal Audit team worked for BuzzFeed and The Financial Times. Forbes, however, says that three of its journalists were tracked: Emily Baker-White, Katharine Schwab, and Richard Nieva, all of whom worked for BuzzFeed until earlier this summer. The Financial Times says its reporter, Cristina Criddle, was tracked. \n\n\"ByteDance’s head of audit and risk control who reported to its CEO, has left the company in connection with the investigation\"\n\nThe Verge has confirmed that Song Ye, ByteDance’s head of audit and risk control who reported to its CEO, has left the company in connection with the investigation and that three other employees have been fired. One of those employees is Chris Lepitak, TikTok’s head of internal audit who reported to Ye, according to Forbes.\n\nIn October, Forbes reported that ByteDance had planned on using TikTok to track the location data of specific US citizens. At the time, the reporter behind the story pointed out that the company admitted to collecting approximate locations using IP addresses. TikTok strongly denied the story, saying that it lacked “rigor and journalistic integrity” and that any employees using the audit system in the way Forbes described would be fired.\n\n[Media: https://twitter.com/TikTokComms/status/1583238909911134208?s=20\u0026t=DDHS4hqMhvCCyGIjfZMPhA]\n\nIt was the Forbes report that prompted ByteDance’s investigation, which ultimately led to the employee firings, according to the internal memo by TikTok’s general counsel. ByteDance CFO Julie Gao has now taken over audit and risk control, the memo says.\n\nThis news couldn’t come at a worse time for TikTok, which is already under a microscope when it comes to its handling of user data and privacy. Over a dozen states in the US have banned TikTok on government phones, and senators like Marco Rubio are working on legislation that would ban it outright in the US. Lawmakers involved with the bill say they’re concerned that the app gives the Chinese Communist Party the ability to monitor and influence Americans. \n\nTikTok has taken steps to distance itself from ByteDance and is in negotiations with the US government to totally separate user data from China. But it’s unclear what the outcome of those negotiations will be. \n\nIn June, TikTok said it started routing US user data through Oracle to appease concerns that China-based employees could access US information. In his memo to employees, TikTok CEO Shou Chew said the company has “been systematically cutting off access points” now that “all” US user data is being handled by Oracle.\n\nHere’s the full internal email from TikTok general counsel Erich Andersen:\n\n\u003e All,\n\u003e Several weeks ago, there was a news report alleging that employees of the company’s Internal Audit team may have attempted to inappropriately access users’ location data. Even though many of the claims in the article were speculative, our Global Legal Compliance team began an immediate investigation into the facts alleged in the story, and engaged a highly reputable law firm to assist with the investigation.\n\u003e We have since learned that a misguided plan was developed and carried out by a few individuals within the Internal Audit department this past summer in the context of investigating significant leaks of confidential company information by employees to media – including purported leaked documents, screenshots, and audio recordings of internal meetings.\n\u003e It is standard practice for companies to have an internal audit group that is authorized to investigate code of conduct violations. However, as part of the initiative to investigate the leaks related to this case, the individuals involved misused their authority to obtain access to TikTok user data. These individuals were aiming to identify potential connections between two journalists, who reported on the contents of leaked documents and recordings – a former BuzzFeed reporter and a Financial Times reporter – and company employees. In turn, they hoped information about these connections would help identify the employees responsible for the leaks. For example, the individuals looked at the IP addresses of the journalists to try to determine if they were in the same location as the employees suspected of leaking confidential information, notwithstanding the fact that IP addresses would only yield approximate location information. Not surprisingly, their ill-considered efforts did not result in identifying the sources of the leaks. Nonetheless, their access to user data in connection with these efforts was a significant violation of the company’s Code of Conduct, and so we are pursuing the following steps immediately:\n\u003e None of the individuals found to have directly participated in or overseen the misguided plan remain employed at ByteDance. We are continuing the investigation led by the Legal team.\n\u003e We are restructuring the Internal Audit and Risk Control (IARC) department:\n\u003e Julie Gao, CFO, will take over the IARC department and begin an immediate search for the new leader, who will report to her.\n\u003e The Global Investigations function that had been part of IARC will be split out and restructured. Going forward, the Global Legal Compliance team will have oversight of all investigations formerly within the scope of IARC.\n\u003e We will be redesigning the investigations process to include an oversight council which, among other responsibilities, will oversee the development and refinement of policies and procedures governing the company’s investigative functions and monitor the functions’ compliance with applicable laws and company policies.\n\u003e We have removed all user data access and permissions for the IARC department.\n\u003e Going forward, where it is necessary and appropriate for IARC to be granted access to properly scoped user data (for example, to investigate fraud involving employees of the company), that access will be subject to, and only granted in accordance with, the Company’s policy and protocols. This step will be coupled with training of the IARC team regarding the new policy and protocols.\n\u003e In addition, we will continue to assess and enhance our access controls. In this case in fact, access to certain US user information in the context of the misguided investigation was already limited by prior transfer of control to the US Data Security team, and those controls have been significantly improved and hardened since this initiative took place.\n\u003e I also want to emphasize that we have an open and candid culture within ByteDance. It’s a core part of our ByteStyles. If you are faced with an ethical dilemma or a reportable challenge, notify your manager, HR, or the Speak Up hotline to do so anonymously. There are many avenues for you to share your concerns.\n\u003e I hope we can all learn from this situation and move forward with a clear understanding and appreciation of our responsibilities – as employees and leaders – to build and operate an ethical business.\n\u003e Erich\n\nThe full internal memo from ByteDance CEO Rubo Liang:\n\n\u003e Our company has always prioritized protecting user data and maintaining user trust. TikTok has taken great strides to protect user data, and leadership has repeatedly stressed that data protection across all our products and services is a critical company priority.\n\u003e That is why I was deeply disappointed when I was notified of the situation Erich has described in his email, and I am sure you feel the same. The public trust that we have spent huge efforts building is going to be significantly undermined by the misconduct of a few individuals. No matter what the cause or the outcome was, this misguided investigation seriously violated the company’s Code of Conduct and is condemned by the company. We simply cannot take integrity risks that damage the trust of our users, employees, and stakeholders. We must exercise sound judgment in the choices we make and be sure they represent the principles we stand behind as a company. Any plan we draft or action we take must be in line with the company’s values and Code of Conduct.\n\u003e We are taking immediate actions to assuage and address the situation. But more importantly, we need to deeply reflect on our actions and think about how we can prevent similar incidents from happening again. I fully support the remediation steps Erich outlined, and ask that we all commit to the steps forward to improve our policies, protocols, and team management related to data access. For example, this will mean that we organize data compliance trainings for related teams, ensure that relevant approvers fully understand the potential risks associated with data permissions and develop sound judgment when processing such applications, and set up a new oversight council to strengthen the oversight on investigation functions.\n\u003e I believe this situation will serve as a lesson for us all. We will work hard to restore the damage, and keep striving to become a company trusted by the public.\n\u003e Rubo\n\nAnd the full internal memo from TikTok CEO Shou Chew:\n\n\u003e All - As you’re reading the notes from Erich and Rubo, I want to add that this misconduct is not at all representative of what I know our company’s principles to be. I’m disappointed to hear that anyone, even a very small subset of people, would have considered it acceptable.\n\u003e As Erich mentioned, the individuals involved misused their authority to obtain access to TikTok user data. This is unacceptable. We will continue to enhance these access protocols, which have already been significantly improved and hardened since this initiative took place.\n\u003e We take data security incredibly seriously. Our work over the past 15+ months to build TikTok US Data Security (USDS) – to ensure protected TikTok US user data stays in the US – is testament to that commitment. In addition to now routing all TikTok US user data to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), the USDS department is limiting access of that data to the USDS department and has already done so across our production systems. We are completing the migration of protected US user data management to the USDS department and have been systematically cutting off access points such that new US user protected data stored in OCI will soon only be accessed by USDS, US Safety, and select individuals within the legal and compliance teams.\n\u003e Similarly, we are undertaking a comprehensive project in Europe and the UK to enhance our already robust data security practices with a new generation of technology and investments centered on our new Dublin data center.\n\u003e We cannot take the trust we are building with our stakeholders for granted. We must continue to prioritize these efforts and not let the poorly conceived acts of a few people undermine the work of the tens of thousands of us who are creating a platform where people around the world can create and communicate safely. At TikTok, we can only be the platform we need to be for our community if we live and breathe our principles in all actions we take as we continue to invest in earning the trust of our amazing global community.\n\u003e Shou\n\nUpdate December 22nd, 3:55PM ET: Added independent confirmation of emails to ByteDance employees and details from Forbes and The Financial Times, including the reported names of some of the executives involved and the reporters who were tracked.\n\nUpdate December 22nd, 4:09PM ET: Added full email to employees from TikTok general counsel Erich Andersen.\n\nUpdate December 22nd, 5:37PM ET: Added full emails to employees from ByteDance CEO and TikTok CEO, along with confirmation of the departure of ByteDance executive Song Ye and the firing of three other employees.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Marco Rubio pushes TikTok ban in Congress","alternativeHeadline":"The ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act is a do-over of Trump’s abandoned TikTok crackdown.","datePublished":"2022-12-13T17:44:17.989Z","dateModified":"2022-12-13T17:44:17.989Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23507418/marco-rubio-tiktok-bytedance-ban-anti-social-ccp-bill","author":[],"articleBody":"Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has proposed legislation that would ban TikTok from the US, the latest in a series of political blows to the social media platform — albeit one that seems relatively unlikely to land.\n\nThe tortuously named Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party (or ANTI-SOCIAL CCP) Act would require President Joe Biden to block all US transactions with TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. It directs Biden to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to restrict access to the service, alleging that ByteDance’s collection of American user data and its vulnerability to Chinese government pressure pose a security threat.\n\nRepresentatives Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) are introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives; Rubio did not name a Democratic co-sponsor in the Senate.\n\n\"“TikTok offers the CCP a unique ability to monitor more than 1 billion users worldwide.”\"\n\nRubio and Gallagher announced their plans last month in a Washington Post article. “TikTok offers the CCP a unique ability to monitor more than 1 billion users worldwide, including nearly two-thirds of American teenagers,” the pair wrote. “Unless TikTok and its algorithm can be separated from Beijing, the app’s use in the United States will continue to jeopardize our country’s safety and pave the way for a Chinese-influenced tech landscape here.” As noted in the Post, the bill would also apply to other large Chinese social media companies, although it only names TikTok and ByteDance.\n\nToday’s bill follows a series of state-level orders prohibiting TikTok on government devices. Utah and Texas banned the app from government-issued devices earlier this week on the heels of similar orders in South Dakota and Maryland. TikTok has been a sticking point for Republican politicians since the Trump administration — which tried and largely abandoned a full-scale nationwide ban, succeeding mainly in funneling money to Oracle through a data auditing deal.\n\nTrump’s plans for a ban, which also invoked the IEEPA, were nebulous and controversial. They highlighted the expansive scope of presidential emergency powers but also drew heavy scrutiny from courts. The Biden administration then revoked Trump’s decision in 2021, replacing it with an order to examine TikTok for potential national security threats.\n\nIn a statement, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said TikTok was working to allay lawmakers’ fears. “It is troubling that rather than encouraging the administration to conclude its national security review of TikTok, some members of Congress have decided to push for a politically-motivated ban that will do nothing to advance the national security of the United States,” said Oberwetter. “We will continue to brief members of Congress on the plans that have been developed under the oversight of our country’s top national security agencies — plans that we are well underway in implementing — to further secure our platform in the United States.”\n\nThe Republican-controlled House could potentially pass a version of Rubio’s bill, but its odds in the Democrat-controlled Senate seem lower, and Biden himself seems unlikely to sign it. In the event it did pass, it would run into the same legal problems Trump did — plus the ire of millions of American users.\n\nUpdate 1:55PM ET: Added statement from TikTok.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew explains how US data will be kept out of China","alternativeHeadline":"‘Nobody organizes data like this.’","datePublished":"2022-11-30T22:32:36.327Z","dateModified":"2022-11-30T22:32:36.327Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/30/23486771/tiktok-ceo-shou-zi-chew-data-protection-us-users","author":[],"articleBody":"TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew gave a rare public interview at The New York Times’ DealBook conference today, telling host Andrew Ross Sorkin that he is “responsible for all the strategic decisions at TikTok” in response to a question about interference from the Chinese government.\n\nThe 40-year-old Chew was funny and relaxed for most of the interview, even if many of his answers sounded straight from the 2010s Mark Zuckerberg / Jack Dorsey social networking is good for the world playbook. Did you know TikTok enables people to express themselves and build communities around shared interests? Chew is particularly proud of BookTok, a hashtag community with over 70 billion views that has become a force in the publishing industry. But asked a question about the negative impact TikTok might have on young women, he demurred. (Actually, that is straight from the early 2010s Instagram playbook as well.)\n\nAt the same time, Chew was prepared and ready for questions about Chinese interference in TikTok, whose ownership by China-based ByteDance has led to calls for the app to be banned on both sides of the aisle. “We take all these concerns seriously, we study them, we have been working with [the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] to solve what we think is a very solvable problem,” he said to Sorkin. \n\n\"His answers sounded straight from the 2010s Mark Zuckerberg / Jack Dorsey social networking is good for the world playbook\"\n\nThe solution is “Project Texas,” in which TikTok will move its data from Virginia and Singapore to a new cloud infrastructure in the United States run by Oracle, which only a team made up of US residents will have access to. The system is “expensive to build, and it’s challenging to do it, but we are doing it to address these concerns,” Chew said. \n\n“We are ahead of the curve on data localization,” Chew said. “No company organizes data like this.”\n\nHe followed up by saying the real solution is transparency and highlighted the company’s transparency reports, saying “no foreign government has asked us for user data before, and if they did we would say no.”\n\nChew touched on a few more topics, noting that the famed TikTok algorithm is “just math” that recommends content based on user signals like watch time and engagement and that the algorithm in the United States is already different than the algorithm in China because the different user groups interact differently. He also touched on Elon Musk’s investment in Twitter, saying that “Elon is a very successful entrepreneur” but that “it’s too early to tell” what will happen next. He did offer a point of disagreement, though, saying that “platform safety is incredibly important” and that “platforms need to invest in trust and safety,” in sharp contrast to Musk’s culling of those teams at Twitter.\n\n“We have a responsibility to invest more to make sure that any trends and content not suitable for young people is moderated off the platform,” Chew said, further suggesting the parents in the audience set up the monitoring settings on their kids’ TikTok accounts.\n\nChew also noted TikTok is the only platform at its scale that doesn’t accept political ads, saying that they don’t fill the company’s mission of inspiring creativity and creating joy. “We don’t think political ads do this,” he said to laughter from the audience.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Is TikTok’s time running out?","alternativeHeadline":"A Senate hearing shows that distrust in the company continues to grow — and ByteDance might be forced to do something about it","datePublished":"2022-09-15T13:30:00.000Z","dateModified":"2022-09-15T13:30:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/15/23354539/tiktok-senate-hearing-china-influence-bytedance","author":[],"articleBody":"Ever since TikTok became the most-downloaded consumer app in the world, it’s been an open question when the ByteDance-owned service would face a level of scrutiny commensurate with its status. As of today, it seems clear that moment is now.\n\nAt a hearing in front of the US Senate’s Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, TikTok COO Vanessa Pappas faced stern questioning from lawmakers. They had pointed questions about the company’s connection to its parent, its relationship with the Chinese government, and the potential for Americans’ data to be misused. And while on one level it was simply the latest chance for our Senate to grandstand about the tech industry while doing nothing to regulate it, the hearing also showcased the growing momentum to take more definitive action against TikTok.\n\n“Are there members of the Chinese Communist Party employed by TikTok or ByteDance, or no?” snarled the insurrectionist Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has fashioned himself as an anti-tech crusader.\n\nEmily Baker-White captured what happened next at Forbes:\n\n\u003e Pappas answered that no person who “makes a strategic decision at this platform” is a CCP member. But with respect to the rest of the app’s staff, she said the company does not vet its employees based on their political affiliations. She noted that no other tech platform present at the hearing asks its employees what political parties they belong to.\n\u003e Hawley continued: “Would it surprise you to learn that Forbes Magazine recently reported that at least 300 current TikTok or ByteDance employees were members of Chinese state media?” Pappas reiterated that the company does not “look at the political affiliations of individuals.”\n\u003e Visibly frustrated, Hawley said, “Your company has a lot to hide. You’re a walking security nightmare, and for every American who uses this app, I’m concerned.”\n\nThis exchange captured the essentially impossible nature of the situation TikTok is in.\n\nOn one hand, it’s true that the other companies on the stand today — Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter — don’t ask employees about their political parties. You can imagine the howling if they did.\n\nOn the other, it does seem fair to ask whether any TikTok employees are members of the Chinese Communist Party, at least insofar as that would create points of leverage within the company that could enable the Chinese government to influence the company or obtain Americans’ data without officially demanding it. (Officially, China never has, according to TikTok’s transparency report and public statements.)\n\nGiven the thousands of people who work for ByteDance and TikTok, and the fact that the Chinese Communist Party has more than 95 million members, it’s a given that some of ByteDance’s employees are party members. But Pappas couldn’t bring herself to say even that — and no matter how performative Hawley’s exasperation on that front was, the mistrust that TikTok is now engendering among lawmakers on that front seems real.\n\n\"The claim seems risible — and reporters keep finding smoke around what may actually be fire\"\n\nTikTok’s task is impossible because to earn the senators’ trust fully, it must prove a negative: that China has never sought to use the app for influence operations or surveillance purposes, never will, and never could even if it tried. The company swears up and down that nothing of the sort could ever take place.\n\nBut the claim seems risible, if only because we know what happens to Chinese executives when they resist the government. And reporters keep finding smoke around what may actually be fire: that Americans’ data has in fact been repeatedly accessed in China; that ByteDance did instruct staffers to promote pro-China content in a now-defunct news app called TopBuzz; that a Chinese government body inquired about joining TikTok to spread propaganda under an assumed name.\n\nTikTok has either denied or shared important caveats to all these stories, which I covered here in detail last month. The most important, to my mind, is that tech companies find it extremely difficult to track data flows generally, and have trouble properly logging access, managing permissions, and understanding the origin of the data and metadata flowing through their servers. (There is a lot of this, for example in, Pieter “Mudge” Zatko’s whistleblower complaint against Twitter.)\n\nAfter today’s hearing, though, it now seems clear that TikTok will be held to a higher standard than its rivals in this regard. When Facebook or Twitter are found to have mishandled user data, or accidentally employed a foreign agent, the worst they can expect are fines and some theatrical grandstanding in a congressional hearing. For ByteDance, though, the same crimes risk the equivalent of a death penalty — TikTok being banned altogether, as it was in India in 2020; or being forced to divest it, as former President Trump attempted while he was in office.\n\nTikTok’s approach to all this has been to market its “transparency” — to reveal more about its operations and algorithms than any of its peers. In a blog post later on Wednesday — titled “Strengthening our commitment to transparency,” of course — Pappas said that among other things that the company would begin reporting covert influence networks found within the app, just as Facebook has done for years now.\n\nThat’s in addition to a raft of other measures that most of its peers haven’t tried, including still-embryonic efforts to provide APIs to researchers to help them study both content on the platform and how TikTok moderates it. The company also said last month  it would let Oracle regularly vet its models for recommendations and moderation systems.\n\n\"Listening to senators’ questions today, I wondered: how could any such agreement put these questions to rest for good?\"\n\nThese are worthy efforts, and I’m glad TikTok is pursuing them. But we are now two years into TikTok’s real transparency era, which began with the (virtual) opening of its first physical “transparency center,” where lawmakers and other interested parties were to be invited to inspect and understand its algorithms up close.\n\nThese measures may have worked in the moment. Trump’s effort to forcibly deliver TikTok to his campaign donors was still well under way at that time, but it fizzled as the president turned his attention to more pressing matters, such as how to overturn the election that he lost. I doubt “transparency” had much to do with that, but at the very least President Biden took a softer tone against ByteDance when he took office.\n\nBut how much longer will that last? The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, is still conducting a security review of the app. Testifying today, Pappas said TikTok is moving closer toward reaching an agreement with the US government that will put these questions to rest for good. And yet listening to senators’ questions today, I wondered: how could any such agreement do that?\n\nParticularly because, as I noted here earlier this week, more and more executives have begun to bang the drum that maybe TikTok should be banned after all. At the Code Conference in Los Angeles last week, Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner said TikTok ought to be banned in every democracy; Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, in his comments, didn’t push for any particular outcome but made clear he was following the CFIUS review closely. (For its part, Meta has been conducting a nationwide influence operation meant to sour everyone on its chief rival.)\n\nIn short, we’ve arrived at a moment where some of the most influential people in the United States, from its lawmakers to its leaders of industry, stand to benefit by pressing the same point: that a TikTok owned by ByteDance is not good for America.\n\n(I’d also add that this has become an increasingly popular point in the press; recently Ezra Klein and Ben Thompson have made studied cases for ByteDance to divest the app.)\n\nIn her opening statement today, Pappas notably avoided any mention of China at all. In the company’s telling of the story, it is a pure entertainment app, owned by a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, created by a distributed global workforce that just happens to have some Chinese employees.\n\nBy the end of the day, though, it didn’t seem like many senators were buying it. And I suspect that may lead, sooner or later, to ByteDance having to sell it.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"TikTok to provide researchers with more transparency as damaging reports mount","alternativeHeadline":"The move comes hours after a report reveals TikTok’s efforts to distance itself from China","datePublished":"2022-07-27T14:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2022-07-27T14:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23280406/tiktok-researchers-api-transparency-damaging-reports-china","author":[],"articleBody":"TikTok is making it easier for researchers to delve into the data and protocols that make up the platform.

But a timely report from BuzzFeed News calls into question what TikTok’s promise really delivers, claiming TikTok employees based in China have “repeatedly” accessed US users’ data over the course of at least several months.\n\nIn recordings of internal staff meetings and presentations obtained by BuzzFeed News, TikTok employees reportedly mentioned having to ask their colleagues in China to access US user data, as they weren’t able to access this data themselves. One member of TikTok’s trust and safety department team allegedly stated that “Everything is seen in China,” while another employee said a China-based engineer “had access to everything.”\n\nThese events reportedly occurred from at least September 2021 and January 2022, and follow similar allegations detailed by CNBC last year.\n\n\"“We know we are among the most scrutinized platforms from a security standpoint”\"\n\nTikTok has faced years of criticism for potentially exposing the data of US users to China, where TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, is based. In 2020, former President Donald Trump threatened TikTok with a nationwide ban and attempted to force the company into separating its US-based assets from ByteDance, calling it a threat to national security.\n\nWhile TikTok never really did sell its US-based assets, it discussed making American software company Oracle its “trusted technology partner.” The deal seemed like it was on its last leg after President Joe Biden took office, but ended up reemerging in March with reports of something called Project Texas. \n\nThis initiative, which refers to the Texas-based headquarters of Oracle, is supposed to guard US users’ data in Oracles servers, barring access from the China-based ByteDance. It looks like some form of this deal is underway now, as TikTok has announced its transition to Oracle’s servers.\n\n“For more than a year, we’ve been working with Oracle on several measures as part of our commercial relationship to better safeguard our app, systems, and the security of US user data,” Albert Calamug, the head of TikTok’s US security and public policy writes. “Today, 100% of US user traffic is being routed to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.”\n\nThe company adds that it will use its Virginia and Singapore-based servers for backups, but it aims to delete users’ private data from these servers in order to “fully pivot to Oracle cloud servers located in the US.” It’s unclear when TikTok plans on making a complete shift to Oracle’s servers, and the company didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.\n\n“These are critical steps, but there is more we can do,” Calamug continues. “We know we are among the most scrutinized platforms from a security standpoint, and we aim to remove any doubt about the security of US user data.”\n"}]}],"url":"https://www.theverge.com/23651507/tiktok-ban-us-news","railComponents":[{"__typename":"EntryRailNewsletter","entryRailNewsletter":{"name":"Verge Deals","slug":"deals"}}],"dek":{"plaintext":"Here’s a roundup of all the news about politicians pushing to ban TikTok or force it away from ByteDance.","html":"Here’s a roundup of all the news about politicians pushing to ban TikTok or force it away from ByteDance."},"leadImage":{"defaultImageUrl":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UzHOBwUWsIDupi8mYo-fKAPBaDs=/0x0:2040x1334/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x667:1021x668)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25336775/STK051_TIKTOKBAN_CVirginia_D.jpg","asset":{"title":"Graphic photo illustration of the TikTok logo in a stop sign overlayed on a photo of Congress.","contentType":"image/jpeg"},"hideCredit":false,"caption":null,"credit":{"html":"Cath Virginia / The Verge | Photo by Brendan Hoffman, Getty Images"},"variantUrl":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ZSEkYL9r02GU_BYFnG5rM-hDkU=/0x0:2040x1334/1100x733/filters:focal(1020x667:1021x668)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25336775/STK051_TIKTOKBAN_CVirginia_D.jpg"},"seoDescription":{"plaintext":"Proposals to ban TikTok or separate it from its China-based parent company ByteDance continue to arise.

Attempts to force a sale of TikTok began under the Trump administration and have continued in the US under the administration of President Biden but have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nOn March 13th, the House passed a bill that could ban TikTok, and President Biden has said he’ll sign it if it passes the Senate too.\n\nIn the meantime, a slew of TikTok bans across the US barred the app from devices tied to universities and government hardware at the state, local, and federal levels.\n\nWhile some experts say there’s no evidence the app has done any more damage or risked user privacy beyond what we’ve seen from companies like Facebook or Google, politicians have continued to raise the prospect of attempting to ban TikTok entirely if they can’t force a separation from ByteDance.\n\nRead on for all the latest news on a potential TikTok ban in the US.\n","package":null,"visibleNetworkIds":[],"scheduledForExpirationAt":null}}}]},"basePath":"/23651507/tiktok-ban-us-news","pageNumber":2,"uid":"Entry:8e163b64-e036-4c31-8f67-1c61b3503142","navProps":{"stickyNav":true,"logoColor":"franklin","lightText":false},"_sentryTraceData":"c85828d40a46401bb18a98e44d1bd81d-8467bc8bbf22fefd-0","_sentryBaggage":"sentry-environment=production,sentry-release=WxXrde3sWGS7cUX1csGoM,sentry-public_key=6547365f9d98454ba8daa58e42013d33,sentry-trace_id=c85828d40a46401bb18a98e44d1bd81d"},"__N_SSP":true},"page":"/entry/stream/[uid]","query":{"uid":"Entry:8e163b64-e036-4c31-8f67-1c61b3503142"},"buildId":"WxXrde3sWGS7cUX1csGoM","isFallback":false,"gssp":true,"scriptLoader":[{"src":"https://theverge.coral.coralproject.net/assets/js/count.js?v=0","strategy":"lazyOnload","className":"coral-script","defer":true}]}</script></body></html>
