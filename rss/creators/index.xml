    <title>Zoomers are turning on the TikTok famous congressman who voted to ban the app</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UgxORa"&gt;Until relatively recently, Rep. Jeff Jackson, a freshman Democratic congressman from North Carolina, had more than 2.5 million followers on TikTok. Jackson’s follower count dropped by over 100,000 virtually overnight — as did his esteem among some of TikTok’s young users — after he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24097125/house-bill-vote-tiktok-ban-china-bytedance-divestment"&gt;voted to ban the app&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gt7WOk"&gt;The bill passed with 352 votes, but to the legions of TikTokers who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/7/24093308/tiktok-congress-ban-push-notification"&gt;called their representatives&lt;/a&gt; to urge them not to ban the app, Jackson’s vote feels like a unique betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tlQCAN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@noahglenncarter/video/7346291613947186475" data-video-id="7346291613947186475" data-embed-from="oembed" style="max-width:605px; min-width:325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@noahglenncarter" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@noahglenncarter?refer=embed"&gt;@noahglenncarter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;An update on Jeff Jackson. Hes losing everything right now because he boted yes &lt;a title="keeptiktok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/keeptiktok?refer=embed"&gt;#keeptiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="jeffjackson" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/jeffjackson?refer=embed"&gt;#jeffjackson&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="tiktokban" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktokban?refer=embed"&gt;#tiktokban&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="foryou" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou?refer=embed"&gt;#foryou&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Stargazing (Slowed + Reverb) - Marcelo De Carvalho" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Stargazing-Slowed-Reverb-7221312697249531906?refer=embed"&gt;♬ Stargazing (Slowed + Reverb) - Marcelo De Carvalho&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2x31GH"&gt;On Wednesday, Jackson posted a video on X laying out the rationale for his vote. “I don’t think TikTok is going to be banned,” he began. If the bill passes in the Senate, Jackson said in the video, he thinks the likeliest scenario is that “TikTok will be sold for billions of dollars and will continue to operate.” His opposition, he continued, is not with TikTok itself but with China’s national security laws and the sway the Chinese government has over TikTok’s algorithms — and, potentially, over American politics. “We got a big example of how that power could be used last week, and it wasn’t subtle,” Jackson said, referring to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/7/24093308/tiktok-congress-ban-push-notification"&gt;pop-up notification&lt;/a&gt; TikTok served users that warned Congress is “planning a total ban of TikTok.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tu5IT"&gt;Jackson also acknowledged TikTok users’ concern that Congress is attempting to pass legislation that could potentially ban an app they don’t even understand. “I know a lot of you have seen some members of Congress be deeply uninformed about this because they don’t use TikTok and they don’t care,” he said. “But I do use it, and I think we can solve this problem and keep marching on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o2sxAg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The best-case scenario for TikTok is that it continues to operate but is no longer owned - and potentially controlled - by an adversarial country. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JsXHliZACJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JsXHliZACJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rep. Jeff Jackson (@JeffJacksonNC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffJacksonNC/status/1767936238625984739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 13, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1dBQ6P"&gt;TikTok users, meanwhile, weren’t happy with Jackson’s explanation. The comments section of his &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jeffjacksonnc/video/7345130701836094762?lang=en"&gt;most recent video&lt;/a&gt;, posted on Monday, is full of people calling him a hypocrite. Some of the comments suggest that Jackson originally cross-posted his post-vote explanation video on TikTok, and then deleted it after a wave of backlash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36hLhN"&gt;“WITHOUT TIKTOK YOUR NOTHING!!! @Jeff Jackson,” said one irate viewer. “SELLLOUUUUTTTTTTTTTTT,” said another. Jackson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSYikU"&gt;Jackson grew his following on TikTok by posting explainers on everything from the Russia-Ukraine war to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23635692/silicon-valley-bank-svb-collapse-explainer-startups-venture-capital"&gt;the Silicon Valley Bank collapse&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ybqtdk"&gt;In interviews with &lt;a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/04/05/rep-jeff-jackson-congress-biggest-tiktok-star-sees-the-app-as-a-tool-for-transparency/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roll Call&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/04/11/tiktok-congressman-jeff-jackson/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he’s touted TikTok as a way of educating constituents about the ins and outs of the legislative process. The app, he’s said, is good for transparency. Since the White House has forbidden federal employees, including members of Congress, from having TikTok on their government-issued phones, Jackson has the app installed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/04/11/tiktok-congressman-jeff-jackson/"&gt;on a separate personal device&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9ag1X"&gt;Last April, Jackson told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/04/11/tiktok-congressman-jeff-jackson/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;he’d vote for legislation banning TikTok “as a last resort,” though he’d prefer that ByteDance sell the app so he — and his constituents — can keep using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mwj9d8"&gt;For now, Jackson can still post, although his posts are being brigaded with comments like “&lt;strong&gt;                 &lt;/strong&gt;.” And despite his recent drop in followers, he remains the most-followed member of Congress on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Are we really going to ban TikTok?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration depicting TikTok over the Vergecast team." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHwDyc3uJH6WLplmQFPcGzu815k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73209314/VST_0315_Site.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Parkin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tv0Uat"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23651507/tiktok-ban-us-news"&gt;The TikTok ban&lt;/a&gt; might be for real this time. Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;four years after&lt;/a&gt; the first attempt to get the ByteDance-owned company either sold or barred from the US, a new bill is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24097125/house-bill-vote-tiktok-ban-china-bytedance-divestment"&gt;flying through congressional votes&lt;/a&gt;, and President Joe Biden has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/9/24095348/president-biden-says-hell-sign-a-tiktok-ban-if-passed"&gt;said he’ll sign it&lt;/a&gt; if it comes to his desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEfzyZ"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://pod.link/vergecast"&gt;this episode of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we talk about what’s inside the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (everybody calls it PAFFACAA, just kidding; nobody calls it that, everybody just calls it “The TikTok Ban”) and what we know about TikTok’s connection to China. The answer: not a lot! But four years in, Congress seems more convinced than ever, and that might mean something. Or it might not. We spend a long time debating what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QkZrXb"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP6905517148" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NC84Mv"&gt;After that, we discuss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/11/24097247/former-activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-is-apparently-eyeing-tiktok"&gt;who might buy TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, whether TikTok is even for sale, and what companies like Meta, Snap, and X stand to gain from a TikTok ban. And finally, we try to decide which outcome is the most likely: a TikTok ban, a TikTok sale, or nothing at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIpyw8"&gt;Once we dispense with the TikTok news, we talk about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24099533/youtube-tv-app-redesign-comments-shopping"&gt;YouTube’s new redesign for TVs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24099337/spotify-music-video-beta-11-markets-supported-artists"&gt;Spotify’s push into music videos&lt;/a&gt; — which are both, in a way, actually stories about TikTok. Neil Young &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24099330/neil-youngs-music-is-back-on-low-res-spotify-two-years-after-rogan-protest"&gt;makes a surprise reappearance&lt;/a&gt; on the show, and then it’s time for a lightning round. Brought to you by your favorite new band, Algorithmic Warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s fate now lies with the Senate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo illustration of the Capitol building under the TikTok logo with a slash through it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZmFxMqtJlgTfXW7xyo-cXR3kARk=/20x0:2021x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73204865/STK051_TIKTOKBAN_CVirginia_C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cath Virginia / The Verge | Photos from Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YhtnAH"&gt;The fate of TikTok in the US now lies with the Senate after House lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to pass a bill that would ban the app unless Chinese parent company ByteDance sells it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYyLas"&gt;President Joe Biden has already said he would sign the bill, the &lt;a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Protecting%20Americans%20From%20Foriegn%20Adversary%20Controlled%20Applications_3.5.24.pdf"&gt;Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act&lt;/a&gt;, if both chambers advance it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTGiKi"&gt;But even though the bill sailed through the House only about a week after it was first introduced, the Senate will present a whole different set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3fjQp"&gt;To start, there’s no companion bill yet, so the legislation is barely at the start line in that chamber. And even if one is introduced, Senate rules could make it tricky to maintain enough support (60 out of 100 members) to clear it. Just one senator can put a hold on legislation to keep it from advancing quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hAtWR"&gt;Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has indicated he could be willing to do just that. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/03/12/tik-tok-bill-house-vote/"&gt;He told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; prior to the House vote that he would block any bill he believed to violate the Constitution and said Congress shouldn’t “be trying to take away the First Amendment rights of [170] million Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQnc2k"&gt;A long legal process could leave room for doubts — and lobbying money — to seep in. Consider the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23629469/restrict-act-bytedance-tiktok-ban-bipartisan-bill-warner"&gt;splashy introduction of the RESTRICT Act&lt;/a&gt; — another attempt to ban TikTok — in the Senate last year just before TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified in the House. Despite early excitement about the measure, it slowly fell off the radar as opponents lodged their critiques. Ultimately, it failed to move through the chamber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="deBbAx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A long legal process could leave room for doubts — and lobbying money — to seep in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8oAZ4C"&gt;Now, compare that to this past week, when TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/how-tiktok-was-blindsided-by-a-u-s-bill-that-could-ban-it-7201ac8b?utm_campaign=wp_the_technology_202&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_technology202"&gt;reportedly scrambled to deal with the surprise bill&lt;/a&gt;, sending its users to flood House offices with calls that seemed to mostly just annoy staffers and leave some lawmakers with the impression that it was just another example of how TikTok can wield its influence machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cQXUx"&gt;Even opposition from former President Donald Trump seemingly did not dissuade Republicans in the House from voting for the measure. It passed with 352 members supporting it and only 65 opposing, with one voting present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jWRwP"&gt;But the Senate could be a different story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJQoAH"&gt;There are already signs that Trump’s comments — that a TikTok ban would only help Meta — may be impacting some Republican senators. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvkTGT9WR1U"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Meet the Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he was “conflicted” and doesn’t know yet how he would vote on a similar measure in the Senate. Graham did previously support the RESTRICT Act, which sought a different legal avenue that could also result in a TikTok ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozg2Re"&gt;But Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) maintained his longtime support for taking action on TikTok’s China ties, &lt;a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-calls-senate-vote-tiktok-end-ccp-spying"&gt;saying on X after the House vote&lt;/a&gt; that “the Senate should take up this bill immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRkO9o"&gt;Senate Intelligence Committee chair and vice chair Mark Warner (D-VA) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) said in a joint statement that they were “encouraged by today’s strong bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives, and look forward to working together to get this bill passed through the Senate and signed into law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKT3SR"&gt;It’s significant that Warner is willing to get behind the House bill, given that he was the lead sponsor of the RESTRICT Act. Warner’s support for the new House legislation shows he’s willing to pursue other paths to deal with the threats he perceives from TikTok’s ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JFBGki"&gt;Other Democrats seem more wary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__y9fbu61nojq"&gt;“We don’t have only a TikTok problem—we have a Big Tech privacy problem,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1767928757287809087"&gt;Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) wrote on X&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, advocating for his own online privacy legislation for children. “From Meta to Amazon to Discord, US-owned companies are preying on children &amp;amp; teens for profit. We don’t need to ban TikTok to fix their invasive practices. Passing my COPPA 2.0 is the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiM80g"&gt;Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has so far been noncommittal about the path the bill could take. Schumer said simply in a statement after the House passed the bill that “The Senate will review the legislation when it comes over from the House.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is revamping its TV app to make videos feel way more interactive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of a YouTube logo with geometric background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlLS92alSIhhd0mblXu4ehOS24c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73204135/acastro_STK092_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OIzLLs"&gt;YouTube is constantly tinkering with its app design across different platforms and screen sizes, and today, the company shared the latest changes coming to its TV-optimized app. There’s a clear focus on making the viewing experience more interactive and giving greater prominence to chapters, comments, and video descriptions — without getting in the way of the video you’re trying to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIfRwH"&gt;The new view shrinks the video down slightly to make space for the description, comments, and other elements around it. It’s not YouTube’s new default look, since many people will still prefer a full-screen layout. But you can easily click into the more interactive interface from the standard video player screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xr3zFh"&gt;“What users will be able to see on their TVs is a design solution that keeps the video front and center, but layers in the ability to access the features that make YouTube unique — all without interrupting the viewing experience,” YouTube’s Joe Hines and Aishwarya Agarwal &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/designing-a-richer-youtube-experience-for-your-tvs/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of YouTube’s new TV interface, with interactive features now positioned on the right side of the screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nl5gkLU9-ZGk8rA1Jjis_Urd9Fw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25333971/Screenshot_2024_03_13_at_11.24.53_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A video’s description and comments can now be viewed without getting in the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="81wHUP"&gt;The design changes started “with the idea of reducing the size of the video player and simplifying the interactions.” YouTube’s design team came up with several prototypes that varied in complexity and then had users provide feedback on which approach worked best. That’s how it landed on this new TV experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THrDRb"&gt;By shifting interactive features to the right side, YouTube is also making a renewed effort to bring shopping to the TV screen. You’ll see a “products in this video” section appear whenever creators include what’s being featured in their content. But YouTube hasn’t quite reached the stage of letting you complete an entire transaction from your TV; instead, the app will display a QR code that you can scan to finish buying an item on your phone. Not exactly seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gySv12"&gt;YouTube says this redesign will also make its way to YouTube TV, which will allow subscribers of that service to keep track of scores without obstructing whatever game is on. As is often the case with these things, YouTube will roll out the TV app updates to users “over the next few weeks” rather than provide it to everyone at once. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok ban: all the news on attempts to ban the video platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Graphic photo illustration of the TikTok logo in a stop sign overlayed on a photo of Congress." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_2-qf9d2_wiO0DwF8x3se_TMXI=/20x0:2021x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72102056/STK051_TIKTOKBAN_CVirginia_D.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here’s a roundup of all the news about politicians pushing to ban TikTok or force it away from ByteDance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="0u3Cou"&gt;Discussions about banning TikTok, the short-form video app owned by Chinese company ByteDance, have seen politicians in the US and internationally accuse it of being a tool for propaganda and a security risk. Attempts to force a sale of TikTok began under the Trump administration and have continued in the US under the administration of President Biden but have so far been unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoCplk"&gt;On March 13th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24097125/house-bill-vote-tiktok-ban-china-bytedance-divestment"&gt;the House passed a bill that could ban TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, and President Biden has said he’ll sign it if it passes the Senate too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JW3SiI"&gt;In the meantime, a slew of TikTok bans across the US barred the app from devices tied to universities and government hardware at the state, local, and federal levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv6N34"&gt;While some experts say there’s no evidence the app has done any more damage or risked user privacy beyond what we’ve seen from companies like Facebook or Google, politicians have continued to raise the prospect of attempting to ban TikTok entirely if they can’t force a separation from ByteDance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZqXx2J"&gt;Read on for all the latest news on a potential TikTok ban in the US.&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>House passes bill that could ban TikTok</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w0FgV9"&gt;Banning TikTok in the US is back on the table after the House voted Wednesday to pass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091278/congress-tiktok-bytedance-ban-divest-bill"&gt;a measure that would do just that&lt;/a&gt; unless the app separates from Chinese parent company ByteDance. The bill passed with 352 votes, needing a two-thirds majority to advance. Sixty-five members voted against it, with one voting present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H34ejW"&gt;The bill still needs to clear the Senate, which is no small task. But President Joe Biden said on Friday &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/9/24095348/president-biden-says-hell-sign-a-tiktok-ban-if-passed"&gt;he would sign it into law if it passes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6VUJr"&gt;The House vote revives some US policymakers’ hopes for a forced divestment of TikTok, due to fears that Chinese law could compel its parent company to hand over information on US users, presenting a national security risk. The House Energy and Commerce Committee last week voted 50–0 to advance the bill, &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/chair-rodgers-we-have-given-tik-tok-a-choice-divest-or-face-a-ban"&gt;after attending an intelligence briefing&lt;/a&gt; about the risks of foreign adversary-controlled apps. TikTok says it doesn’t store US user information in China and has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/30/23486771/tiktok-ceo-shou-zi-chew-data-protection-us-users"&gt;working on a plan to further protect such data&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s done little to quell lawmakers’ fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="koVuh0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Former President Trump is now arguing against a ban&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOjlVK"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Protecting%20Americans%20From%20Foriegn%20Adversary%20Controlled%20Applications_3.5.24.pdf"&gt;Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act&lt;/a&gt; would penalize app stores and web hosting services if they host TikTok, provided it’s still owned by a Chinese company. The legislation names ByteDance, but could also apply to other social media apps owned by companies based in a handful of foreign adversary countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjkm4C"&gt;Standing in opposition to the legislation is a group that includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/7/24093308/tiktok-congress-ban-push-notification"&gt;TikTok users themselves, who flooded congressional offices with phone calls&lt;/a&gt; ahead of a committee vote thanks to a prompt in the app; free speech organizations like the &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-slams-house-for-latest-plan-to-ban-tiktok-and-stifle-free-speech"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094587/republicans-ignore-trump-criticism-and-plan-to-vote-next-week-on-a-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok"&gt;former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, who posted on Truth Social that getting rid of TikTok would just stand to benefit Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yab1Rl"&gt;The ACLU argues the bill would effectively suppress speech, even if it doesn’t explicitly regulate content. It pointed to a federal court’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23651507/tiktok-ban-us-news#stream-entry-32fd2f18-f4a0-4c82-b7c7-6d717944ea1a"&gt;ruling in Montana blocking the state’s attempted ban&lt;/a&gt; of TikTok to back up its claims that the new House bill is unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ykr9PQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jhkRvCSm4tk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GqKO15"&gt;Ahead of the vote, lawmakers argued passionately on the House floor both for and against the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJCsJI"&gt;Several supporters emphasized that the bill is not an all-out ban, but instead an incentive to force divestment so TikTok can separate its ties to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmy17O"&gt;“This is not an attempt to ban TikTok. It’s an attempt to make TikTok better. Tic-tac-toe. A winner. A winner,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24099609/ill-have-what-shes-having"&gt;as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) put it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IhhAjB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It takes no position at all on the content of speech, only foreign adversary control.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hS6v3D"&gt;Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI), who chairs the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and introduced the legislation, emphasized that the bill could not be used against American social media companies or individual social media users. He added that “it takes no position at all on the content of speech, only foreign adversary control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dM1Zpi"&gt;But opponents of the bill on both sides of the aisle echoed each others’ concerns. Opponents fear the bill will be an ineffective solution to real national security concerns, while coming with unacceptable limits on free speech and expansion of governmental power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0QLFj"&gt;“It’s dangerous to give the president that kind of power, to give him the power to decide what Americans can see on their phones and on their computers,” said Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWl8H0"&gt;“I cannot sign a blank check to some future president who would easily and dangerously weaponize this legislation to profit in silence,” said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA). TikTok users who make their living on the app have complained that losing access to the app would plummet their incomes. “Creatives, artists, content creators, and businesses in my district will get caught in the crossfire of this bill and deserve better than federal overreach as a substitute for a thoughtful and incisive solution to this complicated national security challenge,” Kamlager-Dove added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="threads_view_C04PJHEGR9D-1710342536.486919-1710348615.005179"&gt;TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes criticized the process to advance the bill as “secret” and said the bill was being “jammed through” to enact a ban. “We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service,” Hughes said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1bUMqx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Earlier efforts to ban TikTok fizzled out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j3Sb95"&gt;Efforts to ban TikTok heated up in March last year, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23653950/congress-tiktok-ban-hearing-aftermath-china-influence-privacy"&gt;CEO Shou Zi Chew testified in the House&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, then slowed to an apparent standstill until recently. In 2023, a bipartisan group of senators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23629469/restrict-act-bytedance-tiktok-ban-bipartisan-bill-warner"&gt;introduced the RESTRICT Act&lt;/a&gt;, which put the power to ban apps that present national security risks in the hands of the secretary of commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtKn6z"&gt;Although Chew faced bipartisan grilling, some Democrats in particular expressed reservations about an all-out ban. And despite the early push from a group of powerful lawmakers, the RESTRICT Act ultimately fizzled out &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/31/tiktok-bytedance-spent-millions-on-lobbying-congress.html"&gt;amid a strong lobbying campaign&lt;/a&gt; by TikTok and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-16/will-the-us-ban-tiktok-ai-becomes-congress-s-new-obsession?srnd=undefined"&gt;Republican concerns about granting too much executive branch power&lt;/a&gt; over the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVi6I4"&gt;Now is a particularly tricky time to try to pass a TikTok ban, as candidates including Biden are using the app to get their messages out to young voters ahead of the 2024 US elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tYBfD"&gt;But both the Biden and Trump administrations have considered their own efforts to ban or force a sale of TikTok, despite Trump’s more recent remarks opposing such policies. Beginning in 2020, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215961/trump-executive-order-prohibiting-transactions-eight-chinese-apps-alipay-tencent-qq-wechat-pay"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445060/trump-tiktok-wechat-ban-us-apple-app-store-google-play-commerce-department"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; that would effectively ban or force a sale of TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps. Those efforts faced legal roadblocks, and once Biden took office he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;revoked and replaced the orders&lt;/a&gt; with a new one, creating a framework to determine national security risks of such apps. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hUDBQF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is &lt;/em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s newsletter about podcasting and the audio industry. Sign up &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/hot-pod-podcast-audio-newsletter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lBqZy7"&gt;
&lt;p id="jFKuns"&gt;Hello! It’s been a bit since we checked in on the news. Today, I’ve got a look at the ongoing financial troubles at NPR member stations, the shutdown of Rooster Teeth, and the new season of &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UIW6JJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Woes mounting at NPR member stations: “Sponsorship dollars won’t return to previous levels.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0M2zeo"&gt;Two more public radio stations are discussing how they plan to get out of the red: Colorado Public Radio, which is adopting the “broadcast-to-podcast” strategy, and WBUR in Boston, which is appealing to listeners for donations before taking any next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7ygHH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/03/06/cpr-institutes-layoffs-in-audio-production-podcast-units/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;Colorado Public Radio&lt;/a&gt; laid off 15 members of its staff last week and closed its podcast-focused Audio Innovations Studio. Like at WNYC and NPR, CPR is focusing on news content that can easily adapt to broadcast and digital distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9C0Hw"&gt;Citing the same donor and sponsorship woes faced by the rest of the industry, CPR CEO Stewart Vanderwilt said that the cuts were necessary to put the station on better financial footing. In another move that sounds like WNYC deja vu, he said that what remains of the podcasting operation will focus on local news. &lt;a href="https://thisisthesqueeze.substack.com/p/addendum-cpr-is-hiring-two-new-podcast"&gt;Skye Pillsbury&lt;/a&gt; also reports that two producers will come on to support the newsroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4tRXw"&gt;“We are shifting our focus to news-based podcast products — and I would say at the intersection of news and long-form storytelling,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/03/11/colorado-public-radios-ceo-explains-why-the-company-is-laying-off-15-people/"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Colorado Matters&lt;/em&gt; host Ryan Warner. “There’s a couple of reasons for that. One, it’s where we have a very specific strength. Two, we have a lot of the base material in original news that we’ve produced, which can then be used in a podcast or on-demand type project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rDqRT"&gt;WBUR in Boston may be on a similar path, but not before CEO Margaret Low appealed to listeners to help the station avoid cuts. “In the last five years, our annual on-air sponsorship income (underwriting) has dropped by more than 40 percent,” Low wrote &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/inside/2024/03/06/a-letter-to-the-wbur-community"&gt;in an open letter&lt;/a&gt;. “Sponsorship dollars won’t return to previous levels. These are not temporary ups and downs. They’re long-term shifts.” The next step, she said, could be pay freezes and layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElyAYt"&gt;It’s a stark message that (hopefully) drums up some dollars from dedicated listeners. But such contributions won’t address the main point she makes: the challenges faced by the audio industry are not all that distinct from what is happening to media on a broader scale. Instead of pointing to a skittish ad industry, she sees the problem as more systemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OnJVR"&gt;“The old economics of our business can no longer sustain us,” she wrote. “In the digital age, almost all that money now goes to the big platforms — like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Spotify. This is bad news for the news business and has created big gaps that can’t easily be filled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CFsfT"&gt;For-profit media companies have struggled to adapt to the new landscape, and public outlets are even more limited in how they can make up that revenue. I don’t have answers, but if you have thoughts on this, feel free to reach out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAVOiW"&gt;And, as ever, support your local public radio station! You could be as cool as me with my Brian Lehrer hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OPIDrW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooster Teeth shuts down, podcast network up for sale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yqgTWf"&gt;It’s another digital media shutdown, this time at the hands of Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. In addition to shelving movies to save on marketing costs, the company under his leadership has been selling off assets at a pace. Rooster Teeth is next on the list of properties to shut down, with the only component left standing (for now) being the podcast network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRVr6H"&gt;Last week, Rooster Teeth general manager Jordan Levin emailed staff notifying them of the closure. “It’s with a heavy heart I announce that Rooster Teeth is shutting down due to challenges facing digital media resulting from fundamental shifts in consumer behavior and monetization across platforms, advertising, and patronage,” he said, according to &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/rooster-teeth-shutting-down-warner-bros-discovery-1235931953/"&gt;a memo obtained by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The Roost Podcast Network will continue operating and fulfilling its obligations while WBD evaluates outside interest in acquiring this growing asset.” About 150 employees were laid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uOYyv"&gt;Rooster Teeth first made a name for itself in the early aughts as a pre-YouTube hub for web series like &lt;em&gt;Red vs. Blue&lt;/em&gt;. But its podcasts, including &lt;em&gt;H3 Podcast&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rooster Teeth Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, have proven to be a bigger draw in recent years. There is no news yet regarding a possible acquisition of the podcast network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MHauRe"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A new season of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is coming this month&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2D4TKV"&gt;Some news out of On Air Fest last week: &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2024/02/serial-season-4-guantanamo-premiere-date-podcast-1235841611/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; is returning&lt;/a&gt; on March 28th. Ten years after the hit podcast debuted, &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; will tackle the history of Guantanamo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3KG44"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; host Sarah Koenig said at an OAF panel that she and her fellow producers have been working on how to tell this story for a decade. “Dana [Chivvis] and I tried for years to figure out how to make a story that captures what it’s really like there for the people caught inside this massive, flawed experiment — not just the prisoners, but also the staff who built it and ran it. For so long, all the best stories we heard were off the record. But now people are ready to talk,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15b332"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt;, which was developed as a spinoff of &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt;, was sold to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2020. Since its blockbuster debut, the show has published seasons telling the stories of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, a soldier who was held captive by the Taliban and then charged with desertion, and of the ordinary events at a courthouse in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Kate Middleton photo scandal is a rare — and consequential — flub</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BRITAIN-ROYALS-MEDIA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rkViIh8F11C86mQ6S_lqYr7nGmQ=/93x0:3908x2543/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73202099/2071434796.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Paul Ellis / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eTVuIS"&gt;Kate Middleton’s botched photo editing job seen around the world is more than just catnip for tabloids and TikTok conspiracy theorists. It’s also the most instructive illustration of the AI-flecked new reality we live in, a maelstrom formed when distrust and established processes converge and create chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdvKv2"&gt;It’s hard to know what Middleton, aka the Princess of Wales and future Queen of England, was thinking when she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/10/24096762/kate-middleton-edited-photo-royal-family-possible-fake"&gt;allegedly edited her own photo&lt;/a&gt; so sloppily that it’s become front-page news in a bunch of countries. Shortly after the image was shared publicly, the world’s biggest wire agencies, like &lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;, Getty, and &lt;em&gt;Reuters,&lt;/em&gt; issued retraction alerts — called “kill notices” — instructing media outlets to not use the image or, if they have, to pull it, citing “&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/kate-princess-photo-surgery-ca91acf667c87c6c70a7838347d6d4fb"&gt;manipulation&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KlPWA"&gt;The photo was seen by fans as the royal family’s way to signal Middleton is doing well after undergoing “planned abdominal surgery” in January; before this, she had been missing from public appearances for months, fueling tin foil hat theories that something was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx9nhE"&gt;A lot of speculation has centered on &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;the royal family did this and what they’re hiding (which, to be crystal clear, could be absolutely nothing). What’s more interesting to me are the structures in place for Middleton and her family to shape their public image and what happens when that all comes crashing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2LgNzr"&gt;Kill notices are incredibly rare and unusual. One wire service source told me they could count on one hand the number of kills issued in a year. To give you a sense of scale, &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/en/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it publishes thousands of stories a day and a million pictures a year. Getty Images covers 160,000 events annually. That a kill notice of this magnitude happened is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNh3i2"&gt;Part of the rarity comes from the fact that wire services have established relationships with the organizations that submit images to them, like Kensington Palace or NASA or the United Nations, for example. &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; is not accepting and disseminating images from randos like you and me. The palace knows the editorial rules around what kind of material agencies will accept, making what they did even more brazen and a serious breach of protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2usqOo"&gt;Images submitted to agencies are reviewed by editors looking for discrepancies, and in this case, the manipulation was caught only after the image had hit the wires (and the &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4U_IqTNaqU/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram account&lt;/a&gt; of the Prince and Princess of Wales, where the image is still live). Could this case cause editors to apply heightened scrutiny to media submitted by Kensington Palace? Many organizations are probably having these conversations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fq51dd"&gt;Wire services have clear rules about what’s acceptable and what’s not — &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/princess-wales-kate-surgery-photo-manipulated-3863e9ac78aec420a91e4f315297c348"&gt;allows&lt;/a&gt; minor cropping and color adjustments but disallows the removal of “red eye,” for example. But for everyone else, it’s the Wild West. There’s no vetting process for manipulated images on Instagram, where the doctored picture remains up with no note or disclosure from the palace. As of this writing, a bright red alert appears at the bottom, added by Instagram: “Altered photo/video. The same altered photo was reviewed by independent fact-checkers in another post.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1NhF7F"&gt;It’s fair to ask why wire services didn’t catch the red flags earlier — Princess Charlotte’s sweater sleeve disappearing at the cuff is especially glaring. But the fact that wire services pulled the image in unison has brought legitimacy to what otherwise may have bubbled online as simply far-fetched theories. In this case, at least, the retraction from major media organizations holds more weight than amateur social media breakdowns and viral multi-video TikTok investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yT9LWa"&gt;For the past century, the British royal family has had a near-unparalleled grasp of the power of &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-crown-diana-tabloid-photo-recreations.html"&gt;shaping public perception&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/historyofthebbc/anniversaries/june/coronation-of-queen-elizabeth-ii/"&gt;via images&lt;/a&gt;. The doctored photo of Middleton — and subsequent kill notices — is a misfire of historic proportions. The scandal could be seen as a sign of the royal family’s weakening grip on public perception. But it’s perhaps better understood as a reflection of our current epistemological hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUtSBi"&gt;On TikTok, Twitter, or other platforms, people are free to post whatever they like, no established editorial standards necessary. In the age of generative AI tools — not to mention editing programs like Photoshop that have been around for years — “reality” is tenuous. Some people see Middleton’s poorly photoshopped family picture and decide she’s either in critical condition, in the midst of a divorce, or recovering from a BBL; others comment underneath telling her to “ignore the negativity” and that she’s done nothing wrong. When photos can be tweaked in an instant with plausible deniability, they can be anything the viewer wants them to be. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord opens up to games and apps embedded in its chat app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of Discord logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/geU5eekoXDknXdzBSaBudzGh0C0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73200996/acastro_STK062_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdndW8"&gt;Discord will soon allow developers to build new games and apps that can be used directly in its chat app. A selection of minigames and apps have been available to Discord users for months now, but starting March 18th, all Discord developers will get access to a new Embedded App SDK that lets them build these special embedded apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDZbyG"&gt;Discord has used its Activities feature to enable apps like YouTube, promote minigames like poker, and even encourage users to play with a shared whiteboard experience. These apps all appear as an embedded iframe inside Discord, but they’ve been limited to select developers so far.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/If4gGwMy-cJjSo4B9bBBEvUNUfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25331546/Embedded_App_SDK.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re going to see a lot more minigames and apps inside Discord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RDKw3g"&gt;“Plenty of Discord Developers out there have had their eyes on Activities, wondering when they could create their own,” says Discord in a &lt;a href="https://discord.com/blog/headed-to-gdc-2024-check-out-the-latest-news-for-discord-game-devs"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Starting March 18th, Discord Developers will be able to build new games and experiences that can be played directly on the platform with our new Embedded App SDK.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPQ9L4"&gt;The SDK will open up this Activities section of Discord to many more developers, so we’re bound to see a lot more minigames that can be played directly inside Discord chats. “We want Discord to grow into the best place for developers to do it all: build, share, distribute, be discovered, and monetize their work,” says Discord. “We want Discord to be where your App gets its start, where it finds a home in the communities of people around the world, and where it can be easily shared between friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnwTxN"&gt;Discord is also experimenting with a way to allow users to add apps to their accounts so they roam across servers. Developers will be able to enable their apps for accounts, and the experiment will launch alongside the app SDK on March 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l830YLFr5fIuFWFa1ny94b6PwJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25331547/Discord_Apps_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord is experimenting with apps that roam across accounts and servers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9OCN8Q"&gt;Discord is also bringing back its app pitches, where developers can pitch prototype app ideas and secure up to $30,000 in funding. &lt;a href="https://discord.com/blog/app-pitches-2023"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of AI tools won some funding money, alongside an app for artists, a coral reef cam app, and a city-building minigame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZkymZ"&gt;All of these dev-focused improvements come just weeks after Discord announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034705/discord-layoffs-17-percent-employees"&gt;laying off 17 percent&lt;/a&gt; of its employees. Discord is trying new developer experiences to improve user growth, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/7/24093134/discord-shop-avatar-profile-effects-game-developers"&gt;partnering with game developers&lt;/a&gt; to sell themed avatars and profile effects.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic details new Unreal Engine pricing plan for non-game developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of Epic Games’ logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WjbVeWj6g32jfgIZy36JIuZayG8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73200602/acastro_STK108__02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XbtmqQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games will charge non-game developers an annual subscription of $1,850 “per seat” to use its Unreal Engine as opposed to the royalty-based model it uses for game developers. The company announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/5/23905082/epic-unreal-engine-pricing-change-film-automotive"&gt;changes to its payment scheme last year&lt;/a&gt;, and now, it’s providing details on the plan, which will come into effect with the release of Unreal Engine version 5.4 in late April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOBXQ8"&gt;The changes don’t apply to game developers, who will continue to pay for access to Epic’s tools via a 5 percent royalty on products that earn over $1 million in lifetime gross revenue. Instead, the new per-seat (effectively per-user) subscription fee will apply to non-game developers such as those who use the Unreal Engine to make linear content such as film and television shows, infotainment systems in cars, or immersive experiences such as theme park rides that aren’t sold directly to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mnb6c8"&gt;Not all non-game developers will have to pay for the Unreal Engine using the new pricing model. Epic is exempting companies that earn less than $1 million in annual gross revenue as well as students, educators, and “hobbyists.” Companies that make plug-ins for the Unreal Engine can continue to use it for free; in these cases, Epic will continue to get its cut via the revenue share model in its Unreal Engine Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYZFEJ"&gt;The $1,850 annual fee includes access to both the Unreal Engine as well as Epic’s Twinmotion real-time visualization tool and RealityCapture photogrammetry software. Epic says it’s bundling the additional tools ahead of integrating them directly into the Unreal Engine by the end of 2025, but they’ll also be available separately for $445 a year for Twinmotion and $1,250 for RealityCapture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17WgVU"&gt;Epic announced plans to introduce the new pricing model just weeks after competitor Unity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; — and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/22/23882768/unity-new-pricing-model-update"&gt;quickly rolled back&lt;/a&gt; —  a controversial pay-per-download pricing scheme. As with Unity’s rolled back pricing model, Epic says its new pricing model will only apply to games made with the latest version of its engine: Unreal Engine 5.4. If a developer is using version 5.3 or earlier, the pricing changes will not apply until they upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
