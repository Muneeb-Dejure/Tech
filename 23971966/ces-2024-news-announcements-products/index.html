But that promise largely started and ended with smart home tech.\n\nThis year, things were a little different at CES: the idea of making products work nicely across ecosystems bled into other areas of the showcase and rippled across a range of different devices — even putting rivals on the same page to better serve users.\n"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"I can confirm GeForce Now works better with new G-Sync support.","datePublished":"2024-01-12T18:40:39.320Z","dateModified":"2024-01-12T18:40:39.320Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24036146/i-can-confirm-geforce-now-works-better-with-new-g-sync-support","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":"250","height":"50"}},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Sean Hollister","url":"https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister"}],"articleBody":"The service will soon support Nvidia-blessed VRR monitors, and — if your game’s running  above 40fps but struggling to hit 60 — it helps!

This year, the one that caught my eye was The Handy, an automated masturbator — mainly because it was moving in a way I don’t expect to see in polite company, let alone a public show floor. But right next to it was the Oh!, a $149.95 toy coming later this spring that had me also saying “Oh?”\n\nBoth sex toys are made by Norwegian sex tech company Ohdoki. The Handy, a motorized device that moves up and down to mimic masturbation for people with penises, is certainly the flashier of the two. At a glance, the Oh! is unassuming as far as vibrators go. What makes it different is how it vibrates.\n"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Apple won the CES headset game without showing up","description":"Apple announced release details for the Vision Pro just as CES 2024 kicked off, and none of the rivals at CES were as impressive a package as Apple’s headset.","alternativeHeadline":"The Vision Pro wasn’t at CES, but it had a huge presence anyway.","datePublished":"2024-01-12T14:30:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-12T14:30:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24035028/apple-vision-pro-ces-headset-game","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":"250","height":"50"}},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jay Peters","url":"https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters"}],"articleBody":"Apple isn’t at CES, but it had a huge presence anyway.

Apple had already promised that the headset would launch early this year. So the stage was set for its rivals to compete by making CES 2024 a showcase of new ideas about virtual and augmented reality.\n\nUltimately, that didn’t pan out. Lots of companies showed up with AR and VR tech. A lot of the headsets offered similar functionality to the Vision Pro, like an AR / VR monitor for your computer or a substitute TV. But none were as impressive a package as Apple’s headset, nor were most arriving nearly as soon.\n"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"This might be the year of the smart ring","description":"Smart rings were abundant at CES 2024, including the Evie Ring, Amazfit Helio, and several other more experimental options.

After what I saw on the CES show floor, it’s about to get some real competition.\n\nThe smart ring is a promising form factor, but it’s tricky to get right. It’s more discreet and comfortable for sleep tracking than a smartwatch. The underside of your finger is also a better place to take heart rate and blood oxygen readings than your wrist. The downside is that it’s challenging to create a device that’s stylish given how small and flexible the components need to be. Plus, they tend to be pricey, with fewer features than a smartwatch.\n"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"I rode in a Hyundai Ioniq 5 with wheels that go sideways","description":"Hyundai’s Mobis e-Corner System might come to a car near you by the end of the decade.","alternativeHeadline":"Hyundai’s Mobis e-Corner System might come to a car near you by the end of the decade.","datePublished":"2024-01-12T11:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-12T11:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24035050/hyundai-mobis-e-corner-system-ioniq-5-crab-drive-360","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":"250","height":"50"}},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Sean Hollister","url":"https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister"}],"articleBody":"When I was a boy, I wanted a Ferrari Testarossa.

Unlike most CGMs, the Stelo is specifically designed to be an affordable option for Type 2 diabetics who don’t use insulin. \n\nUnlike Type 1 diabetes, where a person produces little to no insulin, Type 2 diabetes is when, over time, the body either doesn’t produce enough insulin or the body becomes insulin resistant. Roughly 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed diabetics have Type 2. However, if they control their glucose levels through oral medication rather than inject insulin, they usually don’t have access to CGM devices.\n"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"A set of Hyundai wheels is the best thing I saw at CES.","datePublished":"2024-01-11T21:31:47.881Z","dateModified":"2024-01-11T21:31:47.881Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24035027/a-set-of-hyundai-wheels-is-the-best-thing-i-saw-at-ces","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":"250","height":"50"}},"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Sean Hollister","url":"https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister"}],"articleBody":"Wheels that turn sideways to crab-walk into a parking spot. 360-degree spins so I don’t have to back up as often.

It’s about time, because router companies shoved Wi-Fi 7 routers out the door throughout 2023, and we’ve been waiting on machines that can put the standard’s ludicrous speed promises to the test.\n\nWi-Fi 7 came to gaming laptops first and foremost, and the focus on gaming makes sense. One of the biggest benefits of Wi-Fi 7 is that it allows for one device to connect to your router on multiple bands — a feature called Multi-Link Operation — which gives your laptop options when it comes to where to funnel its packets. That means that when your 5GHz band is at capacity, it’ll just send the data down the 6GHz pipe, and vice versa. The result should be lower latency when you’re on a busy network, which is critical when you’re not able to wire up with ethernet.\n"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Clicks hands-on: this BlackBerry-like iPhone case could be a winner","description":"Clicks came out of nowhere last week with a blast from the past — a BlackBerry-like physical keyboard for your iPhone.

Over the past few years, some of the biggest names in PC building have been making it easier to hide cables away and build a PC that showcases your skills.\n\nI’ve built a lot of PCs over the past 25 years, and the main part of the process I hate the most is cable management. It often takes me longer to tidy up cables and route them properly than it does to put all the parts of a PC together. It’s especially bad if you’ve decided to build a PC with a bunch of RGB fans and an all-in-one (AIO) cooler. There are more cables to hide and more lighting to reveal any mistakes you make.

Just open the Prime Video app on your phone or tablet, tap the cast button, and alongside other casting options, you will now see the choice to cast to an Echo Show 15 (if you have one).

We talk about the Rabbit R1, which was easily the surprise hit of the show. We discuss Ballie, Samsung’s adorable robot companion, and the tough week it had giving demos. We talk Qi2 and Wi-Fi 7 and the other standards shaping the future of gadgets. And finally, we talk about the future of cars, and what it means that the inside of the car suddenly seems to matter way more than the outside.</p></div><span class="mb-8 font-polysans text-15

CES, but it had a huge presence anyway. On Monday, just before a string of CES keynotes were set to kick off, the company announced that its Vision Pro headset would be launching <a href="/2024/1/8/24001858/apple-vision-pro-release-date-availability-price">on February 2nd</a>. Apple had already promised that the headset would launch early this year. So the stage was set for its rivals to compete by making CES 2024 a showcase of new ideas about virtual and augmented reality.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph my-12 font-fkroman text-17 leading-150 text-gray-13 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Ultimately, that didn’t pan out. Lots of companies showed up with AR and VR tech. A lot of the headsets offered similar functionality to the Vision Pro, like an AR / VR monitor for your computer or a substitute TV. But none were as impressive a package as Apple’s headset, nor were most arriving nearly as soon.</p></div><span class="mb-8 font-polysans text-15 font-medium leading-150 tracking-1 text-gray-13 "><a

It’s more discreet and comfortable for sleep tracking than a smartwatch. The underside of your finger is also a better place to take heart rate and blood oxygen readings than your wrist. The downside is that it’s challenging to create a device that’s stylish given how small and flexible the components need to be. Plus, they tend to be pricey, with fewer features than a smartwatch.</p></div><span class="mb-8 font-polysans text-15 font-medium leading-150 tracking-1 text-gray-13 "><a class="inline-block

That’s why it was refreshing to see Dexcom roll up to CES 2024 to talk about something a bit more tangible: its forthcoming Stelo continuous glucose monitor (CGM), a wearable sensor that provides a real-time look at your blood sugar levels. Unlike most CGMs, the Stelo is specifically designed to be an affordable option for Type 2 diabetics who don’t use insulin. </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph my-12 font-fkroman text-17 leading-150 text-gray-13 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Unlike Type 1 diabetes, where a person produces little to no insulin, Type 2 diabetes is when, over time, the body either doesn’t produce enough insulin or the body becomes insulin resistant.

But even if you’re all in on connecting all the things in your home, there are two things that make the smart home a tough sell for a lot of households. You need your phone to control things 80 percent of the time, and getting all these devices to work together in smart home harmony through routines and automations is often confusing and complicated. \n\nThankfully, there’s finally some real momentum toward fixing these two challenges through more and better interfaces for smart home control and with smart uses of generative AI that make device automation as easy as typing what you want. \n\nMap my home\n\nWhile voice control and smart displays teased a more democratic way of controlling devices in the home, it’s still often faster and more reliable to control your lights, shades, locks, and scenes from your phone thanks to clunky nomenclature and underpowered hardware. This is a problem because it means one person in the home ends up being the master of all the connected things (via a folder of dozens of separate apps, but that’s another issue), and everyone else ends up living in a semi-authoritarian state under the control of said person and their smartphone.\n\n\"One person in the home ends up being the master of all the connected things, and everyone else ends up living in a semi-authoritarian state\"\n\nAs I’ve said many times before, we need more and better interfaces for controlling devices. From ones that blend into your home, like the uber cool Mui Board (a piece of wood that’s also a touchscreen), or those that appear only when needed, like Samsung’s Ballie home robot with its roving projection screen, smart home control needs to be intuitive and accessible for everyone. You know, like the light switch, only better. \n\n[Image: New innovative and intuitive control interfaces that fit into our homes better — like the Mui Board 2 — are what the smart home needs more of. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WkZ9FjFG-0Dx9b6ET5W57xjbupk=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25234830/Mui_Board_Gen_2_7.png]\n\nWhile the likelihood of either of these gadgets ever making it into your home is slim to none, the ideas are good, and I hope we’ll see more like them soon. However, there was one innovative new interface I saw everywhere at CES 2024 that you can actually use today: map view. \n\nAll the big tech companies at CES this year were showing off new map-based interfaces for interacting with smart home gadgets through their platforms, including LG, Samsung, Amazon, and even smaller players like TP-Link’s Tapo. These interfaces present a 3D map view of your home with your connected devices placed throughout, and you can simply point and tap to control those devices. \n\n[Image: Samsung’s Map View lets you select device types and see status of all compatible devices. This is the camera view. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jieuJaQb3flCla4eoDgxamta8e4=/0x0:2048x1536/2048x1536/filters:focal(1024x768:1025x769)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220834/IMG_0427.JPG]\n[Image: This view shows all temperature sensors. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxVu8eQWOAhibLvcEnxJsGQlbg8=/0x0:4032x3024/4032x3024/filters:focal(2016x1512:2017x1513)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25236046/IMG_0425.jpeg]\n\nPut this on a communal tablet (Amazon is bringing Map View to its new Echo Hub smart display and Tapo to its iPad app) or the screen on a smart fridge, and controlling that specific smart light by the sofa becomes a lot easier for the uninitiated than poring through a list of devices in a smartphone app or guessing the name when asking a voice assistant to turn it on.\n\nHowever, put map view on a TV, and it’s suddenly even more familiar to everyone in the household. Samsung’s Map View works on your TV today, and it’s likely LG’s will, too, either using its ThinQ platform or perhaps now that all LG TVs can be Google Home hubs, we’ll see Google move into this space as well. It’s obviously something Amazon could easily do with its Fire TV. Now, anyone in a house can pick up a TV remote and easily control lights, thermostats, shades, or a camera feed with a point and click. \n\nI saw a demo of Samsung’s SmartThings Map View on a Samsung TV at CES using a remote control, and it reminded me of the much-missed Logitech Harmony remote. Map View gives you a simple way to point and control any device in your home from the comfort of the couch without the need for separate hardware. \n\nPush my buttons\n\n[Image: GE Cync is working on a new scene controller / smart button that will work with Matter. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IhBQAf9hSFeHfYoWHV5kcMktusk=/0x0:4032x3024/4032x3024/filters:focal(2016x1512:2017x1513)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25234814/IMG_0386.jpeg]\n\nMany of us still prefer physical buttons for controlling our homes, and that’s where the smart button (also known as a scene controller) is starting to gain some traction as a good solution for smart home control. It’s the light switch, evolved.\n\nA smart button is generally a wireless device that can be wall-mounted to look like a switch or used as a handheld or tabletop device. Rather than controlling a single circuit as a switch might or a single device as a traditional IR remote might, smart buttons can be programmed to control any number of devices or scenes connected to it. \n\nWith the advent of the new smart home standard Matter, many of these smart buttons have the potential to become infinitely more useful, as you can connect lights, locks, shades, robot vacuums, thermostats, and more from different manufacturers and control them all with one push. \n\nFlic, Tuo, Onvis, and others have developed smart buttons that do or should soon support  Matter. However, Apple Home and Samsung SmartThings are the only two of the big four Matter platforms that support buttons right now. Amazon Alexa and Google Home say they’re working on adding it but haven’t provided a timeline for when Matter button support might arrive. \n\nAt CES, smart lighting company GE Cync showed off a new smart button prototype that will work with Matter. Inspired by the high-end scene controllers you might find in professionally installed systems managed by its parent company, Savant, GE Cync’s scene controller is designed to control groups of lights or scenes from each button. With Matter, you could tie in lights and devices from any Matter-compatible manufacturer. \n\n[Image: Nanoleaf’s new smart wireless switches (left, next to a standard switch) work over Thread and Matter and can be removed from the wall to act as a remote control. They are scheduled to arrive this summer. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0hBl-hi7LkZRg5Xw2n2vvG24Gk=/0x0:3859x2894/3859x2894/filters:focal(1930x1447:1931x1448)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25234820/IMG_0314.jpeg]\n\nNanoleaf showcased its Sense Plus smart wireless switch, which it debuted at CES last year but now says will arrive this summer. With six mappable buttons, you should be able to use these to control Nanoleaf’s smart bulbs directly over a local Thread connection or tie the buttons into a smart scene from any Matter-compatible platform to control multiple devices with a single button press. \n\nThe biggest problem with smart buttons is remembering which button controls which scene, group of lights, or other devices. Some, like Onvis, with its 5-Key Thread smart switch, fix this with somewhat sloppy-looking stickers. Leviton lets you order engraved buttons for your scenes on its wired scene controller, but this is still a problem with smart buttons. \n\nLinxura has a neat solution: with a click wheel around an e paper screen, the $100 Linxura smart controller can display four devices at a time, including lights, shades, locks, and fans, so you can easily switch between them and click to control. It currently supports IFTTT, Alexa, and Google, with Matter support coming in Q2 via a firmware update, according to the company.\n\nDo it all for me\n\nAll this talk of control illustrates that today’s smart home still largely depends on remote control. While technologies such as RF sensing are making big advances, the ambient smart home that understands context (and can know when to turn this light on and at what brightness based on who is in the room and where) is still a long way out. \n\n\"Creating complex automations that make the smart home feel magical is becoming easier, thanks to generative AI\"\n\nNo, I don’t think AI-powered home robots are the solution here — LG’s AI Agent robot it demoed at CES felt more authoritarian than helpful, and Samsung’s Ballie’s best trick was its projector screen. But the context connected devices in our home can provide will be key. LG says it is already poised to use what it calls “real time life data” collected from its 7 billion connected devices in people’s homes to learn about how you use your home and react more intuitively. (With your permission).\n\nToday, however, creating more complex automations and scenes that make the smart home feel more magical is becoming easier, thanks to generative AI. At CES, smart home companies Govee and Aqara both demoed ways they’re using generative AI to help users build and execute routines that would have been fiddly and time-consuming to set up by themselves. \n\nNow, with its AI Lighting Bot, you can tell the Govee app that you want “a Barbie Dreamhouse-inspired effect,” and instead of needing to go through and individually program every Govee smart light you own in various shades of pink, Govee’s bot will do it for you. \n\n[Image: You, too, can have that Barbie Dreamhouse look thanks to generative AI. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ouiX5h7uEDsT-0XTmh8tsJnHeM=/0x0:1265x713/1265x713/filters:focal(633x357:634x358)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25234825/Govee_Barbie_Dreamhouse.jpg]\n\nAqara is also adding a new Home Copilot to its smart home platform. At first, Home Copilot will be a chatbot in Aqara’s app that understands natural language, so you can ask it to set up an automation that turns your lights off at 10PM, locks the doors, and lowers all the shades. \n\nUltimately, Aqara says Home Copilot will be able to analyze the usage patterns in an Aqara home and proactively suggest customized automations, including tailored plans for energy-saving automation. With Aqara opening its platform to third-party Matter devices through its new hub M3, this could be a very powerful tool. \n\nAqara also showed off a concept device in its booth to let you talk directly to Home Copilot. The wireless voice controllers have a microphone in them that’s only activated when you pick them up.\n\nAI is not new in the smart home — Google Home and Amazon Alexa have been slowly incorporating it into their platforms at various levels, and machine learning has been powering smart home security cameras for a while now. But the power of generative AI feels poised to bring a sea change to the smart home that will make it simpler to use and feel smarter overall.

Leia is the company that designed its “holographic” screen, and the company has been relatively quiet since that experience. Walking into its private hotel room suite at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, my expectations were not particularly high!\n\nSo you can imagine my surprise to find five tables full of Acer, Asus, Dell, Lenovo and MSI products and prototypes, plus a brand-new 3D OLED phone — each featuring a eye-popping glasses-free 3D screen from Leia. \n\nThat Acer SpatialLabs tech that’s wowed us at CES after CES? Acer uses Leia. Asus’ competing Spatial Vision is Leia technology, too. When it comes to switchable 2D to 3D screens, Leia co-founder and CEO David Fattal tells The Verge that his company is the only game in town.\n\n[Image: It’s hard to show 3D on a 2D screen — but Leia’s headtracking let us use a popular old technique to capture this GIF. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LT2BnDxxqRcFNw0KZtd3IkEB7Qc=/0x0:440x500/440x500/filters:focal(220x250:221x251):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232555/leia_sample_3d_verge_2.gif]\n\nTechnically, those PC deals were all brokered by its competitor, Philips spinoff Dimenco — but Leia bought Dimenco just five months ago. In October, Leia purchased a treasure trove of stereo 3D patents from Philips as well. “We have the IP,” says Fattal, insisting that any other switchable 2D to 3D screen would be a copy of Leia’s technology. \n\n[Image: Leia wouldn’t talk about Dell or Lenovo during our meeting, but it’s very clear the company’s building prototypes, at a minimum, for each. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uWj50lAAsJ24b2BhW7LpU5Ost5I=/0x0:2040x1331/2040x1331/filters:focal(1020x666:1021x667)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232469/leia_ces_2024_006.jpg]\n\nI have a hard time believing it could be that simple, since Sharp’s switchable parallax barrier for the Nintendo 3DS predates his entire company. But it’s hard to argue with the tables full of prototypes around the room. Even Lenovo — which tells The Verge its upcoming 27-inch autostereoscopic monitor is based on different tech — had two laptops on display in Leia’s suite. Fattal confirms both the Lenovo and Dell machines I saw are prototypes explicitly built for those PC makers, not mockups. \n\nLeia’s most advanced prototype is a $10,000 8K monitor housed in what’s unmistakably a Dell chassis, and I would use it for hours if given the chance. That’s something I’ve never said about flat-screen 3D before. No, we’re still not talking about tiny space princesses getting projected into the real world — but definitely better quality than those disposable glasses at the movie theater.\n\n[Image: One of the original Gaussian Splat examples, it’s a feast in 3D, with incredibly lifelike reflections and diffusion. The dried leaf fans looked crisp; I felt like I could make out texture on the table. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JCZqFe_QARmNEAfNxyPcntxpR5o=/0x0:2040x1148/2040x1148/filters:focal(1020x574:1021x575)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232468/leia_ces_2024_004.jpg]\n\nThe company started me off gazing at Sketchfab models of a badass warrior and a New Balance shoe, then this series of Gaussian Splats, a new 3D scanning technique that turns photographs into millions of tiny points painted into a scene that can be rendered like a video game. Each time, the effect was awesome. The shoe popped out life-size into 3D space for me to inspect from every angle; the Splats were like having a window into ethereal yet photorealistic oil paintings. I could count the fine stalks of foliage in a detailed custom model of a house covered in greenery, too.\n\nThen, I played a few minutes of Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 8K in stereo 3D. Not every game natively supports side-by-side stereo like Tomb Raider, unfortunately, but I could see myself tackling an entire game this way that I’d be pained to play in VR. Watching a 3D trailer for the graphically marvelous Avatar: The Way of Water, I felt an unmistakable urge to watch 3D movies on this screen.\n\n[Image: A flat image of Tomb Raider running on the 32-inch monitor. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9sFRBRG8tYWqXHJBmUY-DTTBv4=/0x0:2040x1148/2040x1148/filters:focal(1020x574:1021x575)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232473/leia_ces_2024_009.jpg]\n\nLike Dimenco, Leia started as a spinoff. Fattal and his co-founders were working at HP Labs on ways to move data optically through computer chips when they were suddenly interrupted by an alarm, he told Forbes columnist Charlie Fink in 2020:\n\n\u003e We were caught in a fire drill, and had to leave the lab with everything we had in our hands. We all gathered in the parking lot. \n\u003e It was a bright, sunny day. The sun was acting pretty much like a laser beam, with very directional light. As it heated the surface of the wafers we saw all kinds of cool patterns emerge, which was due to the directionality of the structures. At first, we didn’t even notice what was happening until the people around us were like hey, that’s super cool, what do you have in your hand? So that’s how it all started. \n\nThough he spent “maybe the most excruciating eight months of my life” negotiating to buy the patent applications from HP, we’re no longer looking at quite the same tech that powered the Red phone. For one thing, Dimenco’s optics can go above the display, making them compatible with thin OLED panels, whereas Leia’s original optics were only designed to go underneath LCDs. \n\nFattel also tells me the company initially made the mistake of focusing on providing multiple static viewing angles — a small number of preset “sweet spots” where you can place your head to get the proper 3D effect from the screen.\n\nThe problem with that, as anyone who’s used an original Nintendo 3DS (or Hydrogen) will tell you, is you can get headaches. If you move your head out of the sweet spot where the left image meets your left eye and the right image meets your right, the resulting “crosstalk” can lead to blur or worse. Most people I know who used the original 3DS did it with 3D turned off. \n\n[Image: The New Nintendo 3DS was a rare consumer example of an autostereoscopic screen with face-tracking — but it came too late to save that wave of 3D screens. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DYv_Hz--dEombc3Ygc4jESr-a3E=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232499/DSCF6682.0.0.1413906259.jpg]\n\nThat’s why the 2014 New Nintendo 3DS came with a head-tracking camera, infrared sensor, and machine learning to dynamically adjust the sweet spot as you move, and every Leia screen uses similar tech today. Fattal says Leia’s single-camera system uses computer vision to find your face, and machine learning trained on faces to figure out how far yours might be from the screen. Then, it sends voltage to an ultra-thin liquid crystal to change its refractive index so the proper image is aimed at each eye, based on a “physical model of how light propagates out of that system.”\n\nThe real trick, says Fattal, is also about making that secondary “3D cell” so thin and unobtrusive, you can comfortably use the underlying LCD or OLED screen as a normal 2D monitor the rest of the time. There is at least one compromise: I can see tiny diagonal etchings on every screen in Leia’s suite if I look closely, even the 8K monitor. But these monitors do seem competent in 2D, unlike, say, Sony’s Spatial Reality Display. \n\n[Image: One of Leia’s smallest prototypes is for automotive supplier Continental — it has an exclusive partnership for stereo 3D dashboard tech. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gce9A91fCy4FUDC0hjteO-TVlZs=/0x0:1440x1027/1440x1027/filters:focal(720x514:721x515)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232483/leia_ces_2024_010.jpg]\n\nIn 3D, the biggest compromise I saw in my hour-plus demo was resolution: you’re getting less than half the screen’s 2D resolution in 3D mode. That’s because it has to use some pixels to generate an image for your left eye, others for your right, plus some wiggle room for your head to move without crosstalk. “If it were 50 percent, as soon as I start moving I’d be infringing on the other view,” says Fattal.\n\n[Image: A compact, portable Dell prototype monitor with a glasses-free 3D screen from Leia. While you can’t see the 3D working here, you can grasp how it’s made of left-eye and right-eye views. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p_8a42i_DE3xqVtefXFS_HRspcc=/0x0:281x500/281x500/filters:focal(141x250:142x251):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232634/leia_sample_3d_verge_3.gif]\n\nWith the 32-inch 8K display, I didn’t terribly mind the loss of resolution — but not all Leia’s demos are equal. Though I enjoyed the 3D effect, Ori and the Will of the Wisps looked a bit grainy on Acer’s 15.6-inch SpatialLabs View portable monitor, which has a 4K panel underneath and retails for $1,100 today. Notably, that’s the same pixel density as the 32-inch 8K screen, as both have 280 pixels per inch, but the larger monitor immediately felt like the better experience to me. \n\nWill this tech be compelling on a sub-$10,000 display? I didn’t spend quite enough time to tell.\n\nBut even Leia’s smallest demo — the one on its first phone in five years — felt neat. \n\nLeia isn’t revealing much about the phone, only that a major partner will ship the first 3D OLED phone, in Asia, by the end of the year. But the heavily disguised prototype I saw can already do quite a bit. I watched a 3D trailer for the latest Guardians of the Galaxy, viewed 3D photos, and did a 3D video chat with Fattal from across the room through Leia’s own app. (The company says it has a partnership with Zoom, but it didn’t have an official Zoom app to show yet.) \n\n\"Sorry, Leia wouldn’t let us take pics of the phone\"\n\nI also watched a modestly impressive demo of an app that claims to convert 2D YouTube videos into 3D ones in real time, with an adjustable 3D slider right on the screen. While the 8-billion-view “Despacito” definitely has the typical awkward billboarding effects you see with fake 3D (where people and objects sometimes seem flat like a billboard even if they occupy 3D space), the prototype’s 1080p screen generally seemed capable of creating a small but convincing 3D effect, with Guardians of the Galaxy objects popping out at least half an inch toward my face. \n\nWhile I could definitely see the phone screen’s diagonal Leia matrix if I looked closely at the 2D screen, Fattal says the final version will be higher resolution at 1440p instead of 1080p. \n\nAnd yes, it’s already far better than the Red Hydrogen, I can confidently say, because Fattal brought along an original Red Hydrogen to our demo.\n\n[Image: Leia co-founder and CEO David Fattal with his Red Hydrogen. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iSE9RgceNyQmJDXVCfiOYyRRBLU=/0x0:2040x1909/2040x1909/filters:focal(1020x955:1021x956)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232454/leia_ces_2024_001.jpg]\n\nA funny story about that: Fattal says he’s still using the Red Hydrogen today, and not just in a “I bring it to demos” way. \n\n“Since 2018, this has been my only phone,” he claims. \n\nYes, that would mean the worst phone we’ve ever reviewed has been his daily driver since 2018, ever since Red founder Jim Jannard confronted him about when he was going to switch to a phone using his own technology.\n\nWhen I call him on what I presume is bullshit, he says no, take a look — “it has everything!” he says. He shows me his corporate Slack, his Zoom, his notifications, his credit cards, his Southwest flight check-in, recent 3D photos of his kids. His wife calls while he’s showing me the phone, and he briefly walks away to take the call. The phone is absolutely not in showcase condition — it’s beat up, scuffed, the back panel bulging presumably due to a swollen battery. There are two obvious impact marks on the screen.\n\n[Image: He should probably get that back panel bulge looked at. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LlMAidESYNG8iWDA7JhxOy5coAQ=/0x0:1711x1148/1711x1148/filters:focal(856x574:857x575)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232457/leia_ces_2024_011.jpg]\n\nHe says the lack of software updates can make some things difficult, since it’s still on Android 9, but most apps he wants to use are there. He does all his ChatGPT searches on the Red Hydrogen, he says.\n\nWhy? He says he’s just a loyal guy, it’s the only phone that can take those 3D photos of his family, and he likes how it’s a conversation starter for his company’s technology. People ask him about it on flights. \n\n“The Red Hydrogen project was the coming out of Leia,” he says. “It shaped the company in many ways.” While Fattal says the company had enough financial runway to survive without Jannard’s funding, the Red founder believed in Leia enough to sign an exclusive deal that helped Leia develop its entire suite of stereo 3D apps.\n\n[Image: Lots of wear on this phone — but it’s the only phone ever made with his company’s brand name on the back. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wC99yD1h42ofrQ4Xi05a4kBChBI=/0x0:2040x1530/2040x1530/filters:focal(1020x765:1021x766)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232463/leia_ces_2024_002.jpg]\n\n“The first thing he did at the meeting: he had a mockup of Hydrogen and he put it on the table and said, ‘I want your technology in this device,’” Fattal recalls. “The whole company was effectively working for Jim for 18 months.”\n\nIn fact, the deal meant Leia was still signed to Red for a time after the Hydrogen phone flopped. “There was going to be a Hydrogen 2, we worked on it for six months,” says Fattal. But when Jannard decided to retire, canceling the entire Hydrogen project, Leia had to change gears fast. The company pivoted its supplier to a tablet, the Lume Pad, which attracted the interest of the much bigger ZTE. ZTE, in turn, released a successor overseas called the Nubia Pad 3D to prove out the market. It was an expensive device at $1,500, but the company still managed to shift around 10,000 units, he says.\n\n[Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qQH-y50eUw]\n\nZTE might not be the only Chinese company interested in Leia’s tech. Fattal says that China Mobile was also impressed by the tablet, and hints that a future phone might be paired with a native streaming service hosted by a cellular carrier. He says that a “consortium of companies led by China Mobile” and “content companies like Tencent” are “seriously talking about 3D.”\n\n“Carriers are trying to find a reason to justify 5G, and 3D is a great story for that,” he says.\n\nI’m not yet convinced that 3D is coming back, a decade after its last ignominious death — but I do know that most people never saw 3D at its best. They didn’t experience proper per-eye 3D movies and games without crosstalk like you get in a VR headset. And if 3D is coming back thanks to the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest and associated spatial video, I do believe many people will want ways to see that content without goggles on their face. \n\nPerhaps Leia and its partners can ride that wave.\n\nPhotography by Sean Hollister / The Verge\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"I literally spoke with Nvidia’s AI-powered video game NPCs","alternativeHeadline":"Nvidia and Convai’s interactive CES 2024 demo convinced me: this is inevitable.","datePublished":"2024-01-18T20:31:36.948Z","dateModified":"2024-01-18T20:31:36.948Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24031687/nvidia-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2023","author":[],"articleBody":"What if you could just... speak... to video game characters? Ask your own questions, with your own voice, instead of picking from preset phrases? \n\nLast May, Nvidia and its partner Convai showed off a fairly unconvincing canned demo of such a system — but this January, I got to try a fully interactive version for myself at CES 2024. I walked away convinced we’ll inevitably see something like this in future games.\n\nLet me be clear: the characters I spoke to were effectively generative AI chatbots. They didn’t feel like real people — we’ve got a ways to go before voices, facial expressions, and body language catch up to what’s expected of a real-life interaction. There was sometimes a little robotic stutter and often a short delay before each NPC delivered their lines. Occasionally, they misinterpreted me.\n\nBut many of today’s biggest video games already set a pretty low bar for NPCs. Saddling up to the bar of a cyberpunk ramen shop to ask real questions with my real voice — it exceeds what I expect from the average denizen in The Elder Scrolls or Assassin’s Creed. \n\nHere’s my conversation with Jin, the “proprietor” of that stunningly rendered ramen shop, and Nova, a digital NPC who seems to be a friend. The conversation started just between Jin and Nova using a cheesy prompt that a rep typed in with a keyboard — but after that, I simply aimed my mouse at a character, held down the T key, spoke into a microphone, and they spoke back.\n\nJin, after cheesy keyboard prompt “The Verge is awesome”: Nova, The Verge is awesome, especially when they dive into the latest cybernetic tech and not just the usual corporate news. It’s like peeling back the layers on the city itself.\n\nNova: Oh absolutely. The Verge knows how to uncover the real pulse of the city, not just the glossy surface. It’s like they’re tuned into the same frequency as us.\n\nMe, after walking up to the counter: What kind of ramen do you serve here anyway?\n\nNova: Jin serves up the best of both worlds. Classic shoyu ramen for the traditionalists and a spicy miso ramen for those who like a kick. \n\nMe, to Jin: Hey, Jin, how do you cook your soup broth anyhow? \n\nJin: Well, it’s a bit of a secret recipe, but I can tell you it involves a whole lot of carefully selected ingredients and a touch of old-fashioned know-how. The result...\n\nMe, cutting Jin off: Sure, sure. You’re quite a salesman. Can you tone it down just a little bit?\n\nJin: Alright, alright. I’ll dial back the sales pitch. The broth’s the heart and soul of the ramen here. \n\nMe: Alright, serve me up a bowl. Tell me about the ingredients. \n\nJin: Here’s your drink. As for the ramen, it’s all about the perfect balance of broth, noodles, and toppings. \n\nMe, to Nova: What’s going on in this city, anyway?\n\nNova: Oh, you know, same old mix of high-tech heists, corporate intrigue, and a sprinkle of underworld dealings. It’s the city that never sleeps, after all. \n\nMe, to Jin: Tell me about your backstory. How’d you get here?\n\nJin: Not much to tell. I inherited this ramen shop from my parents and have been serving up the best noodles in Nox City ever since. It’s a simple life, but it’s mine.\n\nMe, to Nova: And you? Any friends I should know about? \n\nNova: [no reply]\n\nMe: Hello, hello.\n\nNova: Hello, hello. Double greeting? Does that mean double the good luck, or am I mixing up my superstitions? \n\nMe: Who are your friends around here?\n\nNova: Well, Jin is the heart of this place. As for the rest, it’s more like acquaintances than friends. That’s the city life for you.\n\nMe, to Jin: I’m feeling a little amnesia. How do you know me again?\n\nJin: I’ve known you since you were a kid, Kai. Your parents used to bring you here and after they were gone—[abruptly cuts off]\n\nMe: What happened after they were gone? \n\nJin: After my parents passed, I just kept the shop running. It’s been a constant in this ever-changing city like a rock. \n\nMe: What are your feelings about being an AI?\n\nJin: I think you’ve got the wrong idea, kid, I’m just a ramen shop owner, not an AI, but if you want to talk about the latest tech over a bowl of noodles, I’m all ears. \n\nMe: Alright, what’s your favorite gadget?\n\nJin: My favorite gadget has to be this old radio behind the counter. It’s a bit finicky, but it brings in the best tunes for the shop. \n\nMe, to Nova: How do you feel about being an AI?\n\nNova: Well, I’m not an AI, but I do know my way around the digital world as well as the city streets. It’s all about finding the right balance, isn’t it?\n\nMe, to Jin: What’s to do around here?\n\nJin: Well, if you’re looking for a good time, there’s the arcade down the street or the night market over on the next block. Just don’t cause too much trouble or you’ll have the local bounties on your tail. \n\nMe, to Nova: What should I be doing with my life?\n\nNova: That’s the m—[slight stutter]—illion-dollar question, isn’t it? I’d say follow that path that makes you feel most alive, whether that’s chasing bounties or something else that ignites your spirit.\n\nMe, to Jin: What do you think?\n\nJin: I know it’s a fine line to walk, but I know you can handle yourself out there. Just remember to come back here for a real meal, not that synth-noodle stuff they serve at the market. \n\nMe, to Nova: What’s your family like?\n\nNova: It’s just me and m—[slight stutter]—y cat, Whiskers. Holding down the fort. But Jin and you, Kai, are like the family I choose for myself. \n\nMe, to Jin: So, how do I know you again? \n\nJin: I’m the one who used to sneak you extra toppings on your ray-men [note awkward pronunciation change] when you were a kid. Figure you needed it more than the stray cats hanging around the back alley.\n\nMe, to Nova: What are you up to after this?\n\nNova: I might head to the Lotus for a drink. Care to join? It’s been a while since we had a night out.\n\nMe: Sure, any good movies playing?\n\nNova: Let’s see what’s—[slight pause]—on at the Holosuite Cinemas. If not, we can always catch a classic at my place. I’ve got the full archive.\n\nMe, to Jin: Wanna join us?\n\nJin: I’ll pass, thanks. This old cat statue on the counter brings me more luck than a night on the town could. \n\nMe: What are you going to be up to instead? \n\nJin: I’ll just hold down the fort here making sure the late-night stragglers get their noodle fix. It’s not a glamorous job, but it’s what I’m good at.\n\nThe dialogue is not particularly inspiring! I certainly don’t prefer it to proper lines from good characters in my favorite games. You can also see how they only spoke in short bursts and how they sometimes lost the thread. But maybe it could be used to populate a whole world with lesser characters or combined with good, canonical dialogue written by a real human being, where generative AI just helps it go further. \n\nAfter the conversation, Convai’s head of product, Nyla Worker, showed me some of the underpinnings in the company’s browser-based dashboard. \n\nJin and Nova, I could see, have their own “Character Description,” their own “Knowledge Bank” filled with text documents they can refer to, sliders for “Personality” traits like extroversion, openness, and sensitivity, their own “State of Mind,” some “Guardrails” to hopefully prevent them from doing wacky AI things (and filters for blocked words), and a memory bank as well. Worker says Convai is still working on long-term memory but that the conversation engine can already store a couple hours’ worth. \n\n[Image: A hasty snapshot I took of the Convai interface. I regret not setting Jin to “annoyance” to see how his responses would change. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i0WdWF6X5DM6ZM54erJ0lb2misg=/0x0:1728x2049/1728x2049/filters:focal(864x1025:865x1026)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25234624/convai_nvidia_snapshot_verge.jpg]\n\nShe also showed me how easy it was to inject new data. It took a single tap of a button to modify Jin and Nova’s memory with an additional text file, and suddenly, they were able to tell me about Nvidia’s new graphics cards. Another button press, and these characters could speak in a new language.\n\nSince I didn’t actually interact with the imaginary world that Jin and Nova theoretically live in, I can’t fully tell what they’re capable of. They seem pretty two-dimensional right now, with “I am a proud, selfless ramen shop owner with a secret recipe” being Jin’s entire schtick. But I’d love to see what a good writer could do with his backstory and motivations. I can now absolutely imagine games where NPCs remember what they’ve seen and react to the game’s script as it unfolds. The right bits could enter their memory bank at the right time, get filtered through their personality and desires, and make a game more immersive and interactive as a result. \n\nI just hope game developers use this to augment their games, instead of putting voice actors and writers out of work. It’s an extremely hot-button topic in the game industry right now. \n\nJust this month, SAG-AFTRA signed a deal with Replica Studios that could let members license out digital replications of their voices. Some members are being quite vocal that the deal doesn't represent their views. Last we heard, the labor union is still negotiating with game publishers for a new Interactive Media Agreement. It has listed “the existential threat to member work posed by the unregulated use of AI” as one of its primary concerns. \n\n[Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3qOhCAcM28]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"This smartwatch has the tech that sparked the Apple Watch ban","alternativeHeadline":"Masimo let me try on a prototype of its forthcoming Freedom smartwatch.

That medical tech company is Masimo, and it’s known within the medical community for its pulse oximetry technology, used for measuring blood oxygen levels.\n\nThe company would also like to be known for something else: its brand-new smartwatch, which features the tech that got the Apple Watch in trouble. \n\nMasimo isn’t traditionally a gadget maker, but its new watch — the Freedom — is meant to be a true consumer device: something that looks stylish on the wrist, can relay your notifications, and will track your health while it’s at it. On paper, that sounds an awful lot like the Apple Watch.\n\nI got to see an early prototype of the Freedom at CES last week, and in person, it’s an intriguing product. For starters, it’s visually distinct from the Apple Watch, in that it’s opted for a circular display with a leather band, with no digital crown in sight. To scroll, there’s a unique touch bar on the right side on which you swipe up and down to navigate. On the left, if you squint, there’s a small button that you use to select items in the Freedom’s interface. At 46mm, it’s chunky on my petite wrist, but it didn’t look out of place on Eugene Goldberg, Masimo’s president of consumer health.\n\n[Image: The Freedom prototype sports a unique touch bar for scrolling. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2s6uwqYHJx_84tGqcgfPTK8IeyI=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232600/IMG_3074.jpg]\n\n“It’s really adding the convenience functionality that a consumer is used to having, in addition to tracking all of the things they’re doing,” Goldberg says. The Freedom will have features like notifications, timers, and a smoother app experience. On the health front, it also features insights into sleep and stress. \n\nEven so, what I saw was the bones of a fairly basic smartwatch. There weren’t a whole lot of menus to go through, and the software was clearly a beta version that wasn’t ready for primetime. As a prototype, it was clear the platform was still evolving.\n\nFocusing on smarter features is a change in strategy for Masimo — because, technically, the company has tried its hand at smartwatches before. The Masimo W1 launched last year to little, if any, fanfare. But the W1 leaned heavily into the health side of things. It received FDA clearance for blood oxygen and pulse rate but was lacking on the smart and productivity side of the equation. Goldberg describes the W1 as the sort of device you’d get for an elderly relative who’s concerned about their health, not someone who’s keen on their tracker acting as an extension of their smartphone. Even though it looks like an Apple Watch, the W1 is more of a fitness band to the Freedom’s smartwatch. \n\nIn our meeting, Goldberg emphasized that Masimo’s goal with the Freedom watch is to showcase the accuracy of its sensors — not fire potshots at Apple. In particular, he highlighted that unlike some competitors (Goldberg declined to name names), Masimo’s blood oxygen tech is able to account for challenges like motion, low perfusion or bad blood flow, and skin pigmentation. Goldberg also says it’s a bit too early to tell whether the Freedom will get FDA clearance, though he tells me that it will have the same medical-grade sensor as the W1. \n\n[Image: The Freedom (right) will have the same medical-grade sensor as Masimo’s existing W1 smartwatch. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nx836fIG_HA_ydww4RzMRpdxZlc=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25232604/IMG_3076.jpg]\n\n“Even as technology in general gets better, we need to create an expectation of what accuracy and ‘continuous’ [monitoring] actually means. You go to the CES show floor and in digital health, ‘continuous’ is everywhere, but I don’t necessarily believe they’re all truly continuous,” Goldberg says. “You want to know where’s the good data, where’s the bad data, and then how do you as a health professional actually work with that data? That’s where all this is going.” \n\nGoldberg is right about the shortcuts other watches take with their health readings. Many big-name wearables don’t actually scan for your heart rate (or blood oxygen) each second; many opt to prioritize battery life by measuring once every few minutes. Other companies are trying to make this distinction a selling point, too: Movano was at CES this year touting the accuracy of it medical-grade smart ring, and a few years ago, Omron showed up with an FDA-cleared smartwatch capable of measuring your blood pressure. \n\nEven so, Masimo’s timing is uncanny. The company was relatively unknown to consumers when its W1 smartwatch launched, but the Apple Watch ban has since catapulted the company and its blood oxygen sensor tech into the news. It’s still not quite as recognizable as Apple or Samsung, but the drama helped the Freedom to stand out a bit from the myriad trackers and wearables on the CES show floor. \n\nWhether it’ll continue to stand out depends on if the watch can hold its own when it launches later this year — and, perhaps, whether the Apple Watch has its blood oxygen feature back.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Wearing a German Bionic exoskeleton was an awesome and deeply weird experience.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-14T20:33:24.445Z","dateModified":"2024-01-14T20:33:24.445Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/14/24038063/wearing-a-german-bionic-exoskeleton-was-an-awesome-and-deeply-weird-experience","author":[],"articleBody":"The German Bionic Apogee+ is designed to protect backs of medical workers lifting patients out of beds and wheelchairs.

From large language model-powered voice assistants in cars to the Rabbit R1, the technology you heard about everywhere was AI. It was a little too much.\n\nIt may be the year of AI at CES, but many of these “AI” features have been around for a while — it’s just that companies are only now embracing the branding of artificial intelligence. AI has entered the public consciousness: it’s cool and hip to place it front and center in a product, a sign that companies are ambitious and forward thinking. That’s led the term to be adopted wherever possible, even when it’s not strictly the AI most people know. \n\nBut as more companies rebrand anything involving algorithms as AI, how are we meant to separate the chaff from the wheat? And more importantly, wouldn’t this lead to overpromising what AI can do?\n\n\"It’s understandable that companies want to take advantage of the AI hype\"\n\n Whether new products use generative AI or not, slapping the label AI onto something gives the impression that a feature is new and exciting. Generative AI is also still in the throw-it-at-everything phase of growth. People want to figure out how far they can take the technology and want to believe it will be the big differentiator. This is why we’re seeing everything from Walmart using AI models to restock your pantry to car companies cramming ChatGPT into their dashboard to give drivers something to talk to. \n\nArun Chandrasekaran, an analyst at Gartner, said this is normal for many companies, but it does run the risk of overpromising to consumers when they find out something marked as AI isn’t actually like ChatGPT. \n\n“There is a conflation now of generative AI and other AI that could muddle the field a little bit,” Chandrasekaran said. “Marketers might be shooting themselves in the foot when they advertise something that ends up not being what people expected.” \n\nFor better or worse, most people believe that AI is synonymous with generative AI — more specifically, ChatGPT. This creates an impression that if a consumer uses a product branded as AI, they expect it to behave the same way as a chatbot that “thinks” like a human. \n\nThis is a disservice to products that use other forms of AI that are equally impressive. Many of the robots roaming around CES, like Samsung’s Ballie or LG’s AI agent robot thing (it’s not strictly an AI agent; AI agents refer to AI software, usually a chatbot of sorts, that can do tasks such as book a flight or find a table at a restaurant), are cute and feats of engineering. But their existence has more to do with advancements in robotics and even computer vision than the rise of LLMs. (At least we don’t know if Samsung used LLMs to help train Ballie). \n\nAnd then there’s machine learning. AI experts will argue that generative AI and the foundation models that power many versions of it are merely the next stage of development for machine learning. But no one wants to talk about machine learning anymore. It’s considered old and “traditional,” and yet I’m sure it’s what’s powering so many of the pattern recognition features at CES.\n\n“Technology passes through lifecycles, and yes, we may get to the point in AI that people are disillusioned with its promise after not seeing it solve many of the problems people think it will solve. But that’s when you see many good innovations and better fitting use cases come out,” said Chandrasekaran. \n\nIn the next few years, we’re going to see features and products that don’t need a chatbot or a powerful large language model. It’s just not at this CES. Not yet.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"LG’s other transparent TV is the one I want in my living room.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-12T21:35:49.970Z","dateModified":"2024-01-12T21:35:49.970Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24035924/lgs-other-transparent-tv-is-the-one-i-want-in-my-living-room","author":[],"articleBody":"LG’s DukeBox is pitched as a modern-day jukebox, but in person, it’s got much more potential. \n\nA smooth-sounding 3D audio speaker with a 30-inch transparent OLED display that lets you see its retro-style insides and displays album art, the DukeBox is also a TV.\n\nThe music controls on the screen are just for show — it’s not a touch screen.

Not just because it kicks off the year, or because it brings nearly every major tech company under one roof, or because it means a flood of new products. We love it because of the surprises: every year, without fail, there is some strange and surprising new tech that captures our attention and makes us want to tell everyone, “come look at this.”\n\nThis year was no exception. AI took physical form, screens bent and disappeared, car platforms morphed. Even some of the more practical stuff — common standards and simple spec bumps — made a difference.\n\nBut there were also a bunch of products that we simply couldn’t get out of our heads. And to those, we’re giving our annual Verge Awards — our recognition that they’re doing something exciting, unique, or ambitious that might just push their categories forward. Or, at least, that makes us want to put them in our homes.\n\n[Video: Best of CES 2024]\n\nBest TV\n\nSamsung’s glare-free OLED TV\n\n[Image: Samsung’s glare-free S95D TV. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0TIdY2WqGiPoUMr_95shNVG8G8U=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25210956/DSCF6002.jpg]\n\nSamsung’s flagship OLED TV for 2024 adds a new glare-free screen treatment that severely reduces annoying reflections — even in sunny rooms. Many top-tier TVs already have respectable anti-reflective coatings, but Samsung’s S95D takes a bigger step toward eliminating distractions without negatively affecting picture quality. It’s a quality-of-life improvement that anyone can appreciate.\n\nThe S95D is also rumored to be using Samsung Display’s very latest QD-OLED panel, which is measuring peak brightness levels upward of 3,000 nits. Now, that doesn’t necessarily mean Samsung Electronics will crank the display that hard on the S95D, but even if it doesn’t go full blast, you’re still in for a wonderful viewing experience. Sure, some of the Mini LED TVs from TCL and Hisense on the CES show floor can go even brighter, but OLEDs still get my pick for their viewing angle flexibility. \n\nUnfortunately, like all Samsung TVs, the S95D continues to omit Dolby Vision, which makes the whole thing a nonstarter for some home theater enthusiasts. If you want Dolby Vision and a superb OLED experience, LG’s G4 is worth serious consideration. But Samsung’s S95D adds something practical — and a lot of people are going to enjoy simply seeing their TV better. — Chris Welch\n\nBest gaming trend\n\nClutter-free PC builds\n\n[Image: MSI’s Project Zero motherboard. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qv1LWJLPwuwwNcFrDf7gBuq612g=/0x0:2370x1246/2370x1246/filters:focal(1185x623:1186x624)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25218915/INTEL_B760M_PROJECT_ZERO.jpg.jpg]\n\nOur pick here isn’t an individual product, but more of a call for “more of this please.” MSI, Phanteks, Asus, and Maingear are all working on reducing or eliminating the cable clutter that you have to deal with when building a PC.\n\nAt CES, MSI launched its Project Zero motherboards that put the connectors on the rear so you don’t have to route as many cables. Meanwhile, Asus has a new RTX 4090 that ditches the power connector for a cable-free look, and Phanteks is making changes to its NV9 case for Maingear to ship in pre-built systems. Combined with the industry moving to daisy-chained fans, the result is showcase PCs that look great and are much easier to build. I just hope the PC manufacturers can work together to create some standards around this stuff. — Tom Warren\n\nMost likely to succeed\n\nQi2\n\n[Image: Anker MagGo power bank was one of many Qi2 chargers announced this week. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N5WifZrSIVZyzFODj7L0XmJouHM=/0x0:3200x2126/3200x2126/filters:focal(1600x1063:1601x1064)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212642/Anker_Qi2_handson_3.jpg]\n\nQi2 takes the best parts of MagSafe — the magnets and the 15W charging — and makes them part of the Qi wireless charging standard. It rules to plonk your phone down onto a magnetic stand and know it’s gonna stay put and charge fast. Qi2 chargers don’t require special Apple hardware or certification, are less expensive to produce, and work just as well as MagSafe. And they were everywhere at CES: there are already way more Qi2 chargers than there ever were official MagSafe ones. \n\nQi2 is already good for iPhone users, who can now get MagSafe speed without paying MagSafe money. It’s also driving down the price of MagSafe-certified chargers. Even MagSafe doesn’t quite cost MagSafe money anymore. But the real action will come when Qi2 starts showing up on Android phones (my money is on the Pixel 9). I didn’t know how useful MagSafe was until I got it, and it’s great that any company will be able to build it into their phones going forward. — Nathan Edwards\n\nBest wearable\n\nEvie Ring\n\n[Image: The Evie Ring. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VN-UYZs_Al-mhLeE3QTPKtx_nSs=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212486/eviering1.jpg]\n\nSmart rings were out in force at CES. Of them, Movano’s Evie Ring stood out the most. I first saw this device as a concept at CES 2022, and it’s so rare to see CES concepts become actual gadgets you can buy. The $269 Evie Ring starts shipping later this month, and that in and of itself is a feat.\n\nBeyond actually shipping, there’s a lot to like about this smart ring. The design is clever, with an open gap up top that allows the ring to flex. No more struggling to get a ring off when your fingers swell! But the thing I appreciate most is how dedicated Movano’s been to ensuring the accuracy of its sensors. It doesn’t need FDA clearance for its feature set, but it’s been seeking clearance anyway. It’s been a hot second since I’ve seen a smart ring other than the Oura Ring, so I’m stoked to get my hands on one for review. — Victoria Song \n\nBest car\n\nKia PV5\n\n[Image: Kia’s PV5. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t7cI_MPPtqDKob-QrfIhnh47F5Y=/0x0:1000x600/1000x600/filters:focal(500x300:501x301)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220204/lineup_pv5_main.jpg]\n\nYeah, it’s a bland-looking blob that resembles the minivan you were driving when you got dumped your junior year while “Semi-Charmed Life” was playing on the radio and you still haven’t really recovered. (No, I’m not in therapy. Why do you ask?) But the boring design isn’t an accident; it’s the whole point. Kia wants the PV5 to be a blank slate so it can sell it to businesses and let them imprint their own identity onto it.\n\nPairing a flexible chassis with a fixed cabin and interchangeable cargo area is legitimately an exciting idea that I can’t believe hasn’t really been tried before. Also, it’s a van, and despite past traumas, vans are lawful good. They have short overhangs, shorter hoods, and are exponentially safer to operate than giant trucks and SUVs. Yeah, it doesn’t look as sleek or cool as some of the other concepts released at this show, but in terms of the idea it represents, I think the Kia PV5 could be a real game-changer. — Andrew J. Hawkins\n\nMost irrationally loved product\n\nBallie\n\n[Image: The latest incarnation of Ballie. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DjhfcR8_hPO7uw-anWqA6ttExUY=/0x0:1760x1315/1760x1315/filters:focal(880x658:881x659)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220213/ballie2024.png]\n\nOh, Ballie. This little bot has been rolling around our brains since Samsung announced the thing in 2020. It got a big upgrade this year, though, and Ballie now doubles as a moving projector — you know, in case you want it to display a workout video onto your wall or project a little greeting message on your floor when you come home. It can also do more practical things like control your air conditioner, turn your lights on and off, manage home appliances, and check in on your pets. \n\nAs bad as we may want to come home to our own little BB-8, we unfortunately have to face the reality that there is little chance life with Ballie will ever be as simple, charming, and functional as Samsung makes it sound. And that’s assuming the little robot even comes out. It’s already been four years, and there’s no sign of pricing or availability. But I’m going to stay positive and hope that maybe, just maybe, 2024 is the year for Ballie. Please don’t make me break Ballie out of its glass case, Samsung. — Emma Roth\n\nBest health tech\n\nDexcom Stelo\n\n[Image: The Stelo will look similar to the CGM pictured here. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSUNiYnWDhqtYpbtFJ3jexUnpgw=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25219921/IMG_3067.jpg]\n\nEvery year at CES, I see a ton of blood glucose monitoring tech. Most of it is in the very early stages and unlikely to show up in our lives in the near term. That’s why it was so refreshing to meet up with Dexcom and talk about its Stelo continuous glucose monitor (CGM). What makes this different is that it’s for Type 2 diabetics who don’t need to take insulin, and it’s designed to be affordable. \n\nType 2 diabetes is tricky because it accounts for 90-95 percent of all diagnosed diabetes cases, and yet many people don’t have a clear understanding of what foods spike their blood sugar or what strategies can mitigate it. Unlike a typical CGM, the Stelo doesn’t revolve around when you should take insulin. Instead, it emphasizes educating people on how best to use blood glucose data in managing their condition day to day. Price will depend on insurance, but the whole idea is to make it affordable enough for people who don’t have good coverage. (And frequently, CGMs are not covered by insurance for people who aren’t dependent on insulin.) Stelo is currently going through the FDA clearance process and is expected to launch later this year. When it does, it could positively impact the millions of people with both Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. That’s pretty neat. — Victoria Song\n\nBest monitor\n\nAlienware AW3225QF\n\n[Image: Dell’s Alienware AW3225QF monitor. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3_hlRZJSKl7mZCiY07Lozi2zZM=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220259/GDfRuPVWwAAZ8F0.jpg]\n\nThis year’s CES is full of incredible OLED monitors. Samsung Display and LG Display outdid themselves this year, securing spots for gorgeous high-res screens in monitors from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, MSI... you name ‘em. Some can change their stripes at the push of a button, some can fold in half.\n\nBut the best is the utterly practical yet completely fantastic Alienware AW3325QF, with its 31.5-inch, 240Hz, 4K-resolution QD-OLED curved screen from Samsung. It might finally be the best of all worlds: the color and inky blacks of OLED, the brightness of quantum dots, the speed for competitive gaming, the resolution to make out fine detail. All in a single monitor big and curved enough to immerse without being so head-spinningly gigantic you need to rearrange your life around it.\n\nYes, other companies may get this same screen — I saw 32-inch 4K 240Hz OLEDs at Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI, for example. But the $1,200 Alienware is the only one shipping now, during CES itself. There’s one on my desk at home, and the first few days I spent with it were wonderful, without any auto-dimming headaches. Also: Alienware is the only brand offering a three-year burn-in warranty on OLED with next-business-day replacements.

Every member of the team here in Las Vegas made the pilgrimage to Kohler’s booth to check out the somewhat polarizing product.\n\nWhile the smart toilet actually launched at CES last year (with voice control, a bidet, speakers, and a motion-activated seat), in 2024 it came sporting a new look. Instead of LED light panels, it’s wrapped in E Ink panels with ten different shifting designs. It certainly could add some je ne sais quoi to your daily ablutions.\n\nSadly, for those of us who fell in love with the toilet’s unique look, it’s probably vaporware; Kohler tells me it’s “very much a concept at this point.” But should it make it, you’ll be able to choose the E ink look at checkout when ordering the $10,000 smart toilet. — Jennifer Pattison Tuohy\n\nBest laptop idea\n\nThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\n\n[Image: The ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid in laptop mode. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ABkMPdqTJz52y75ctuOJQ2nVXFM=/0x0:3000x1688/3000x1688/filters:focal(1500x844:1501x845)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212756/DSC09181.jpg]\n[Image: The ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid in tablet mode. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oKXUQZ_bs_tgeiUIjIR3tZkMAn4=/0x0:3000x1688/3000x1688/filters:focal(1500x844:1501x845)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212749/DSC09177.jpg]\n\nProcessors have gotten a lot more efficient in recent years. That means laptops can get even thinner and still be powerful enough to get most of your work done — it also means companies can do really fun stuff like effectively put two actual computers into one laptop.\n\nThat’s what Lenovo did with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid. It’s all Windows machine on the bottom, and there’s a whole Android tablet built into the display. So when you’re done doing work that requires a proper laptop, you can just yank the display off the device and start playing with your tablet. It’s by no means perfect: there’s no neat software solution for linking the two devices together and quickly moving files around, but maybe that will change by the time the device launches in Q2.  — Alex Cranz\n\nBest smart home product\n\nEcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra\n\n[Image: EcoFlow’s Delta Pro Ultra pairs an inverter with multiple batteries to store power for a home. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y9LeUI1-EllPDSA8ZxQsropb4no=/0x0:8000x4480/8000x4480/filters:focal(4000x2240:4001x2241)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151398/Garage_1_DPU_SHP2.png]\n\nAs I type this from the CES show floor, I’m getting weather alerts that another superstorm is bearing down on my house in South Carolina. That’s the second this week, and the power will probably go out, again. I need a battery backup solution, and I am not alone. \n\nThat’s one reason the EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra — a whole-home battery generator — caught my eye. The other is its relatively easy installation process, portability (you can unhook the battery and take it to do things like power your RV for the weekend), and modular approach to building a smart home energy management system.\n\nYou can start out with just one battery and inverter ($5,799) that can power your home’s essential devices for a couple of days and then build up to a bigger system with up to three inverters and 15 batteries that could power the entire home for over a month.\n\nBut beyond being a disaster backup and portable power solution, EcoFlow’s system can save you money over time as you scale it for energy independence. Smart home energy management is a crucial part of the smart home; connecting all the appliances in our home makes a lot of sense when it can automatically reduce energy consumption. The EcoFlow’s new system lets you do exactly that. Pair the DPU with home solar panels, EcoFlow’s new connected subpanel, the Smart Home Panel 2 ($1,899), and the EcoFlow app, and let it intelligently manage your power use. — Jennifer Pattison Tuohy\n\nMost in Show\n\nAI\n\n[Image: The official CES art is intended to look AI generated. The Consumer Technology Association told The Verge it was created by human artists who used AI systems to “give each character a generative look.” https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f58-wDRSaHQKUJfG2XDJuHdMamE=/0x0:744x500/744x500/filters:focal(372x250:373x251)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220289/1500x500.jpeg]\n\nIf you were at CES this year, you could not escape AI. Dozens of product categories had ChatGPT capabilities slapped onto them, while others shrewdly snuck AI into the marketing. Cars got AI. Fitness trackers and exercise equipment got AI coaches. Laptops touted new processors that are better at handling AI workflows. Beauty tech gadgets used AI to customize the perfect skincare or foundation for you. The smart home also got a flurry of AI-powered appliances and robots. (Did you know Ballie has AI now, too?) The Rabbit R1 was one of the buzziest gadgets at the show, and we’re not even really sure what it’s for. Hell, even the official CES art looked like it was generated by AI.\n\nIf AI could be shoved into a product, it was — whether it made sense or not. — Victoria Song\n\nBest concept\n\nHonda Zero Saloon\n\n[Image: Honda’s Saloon EV concept. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-HtNdJokXKIfJ0XUhd260R3LQI=/0x0:6000x3074/6000x3074/filters:focal(3000x1537:3001x1538)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212376/c_BSALOON.jpg]\n\nNow this is what a concept car is supposed to look like: sleek, seductive, maybe even a little villainous, but in a good way. Sure, the front end looks like it’s about to get jammed after sucking up one of my G.I. Joes, but the sloping hood and roof is genuinely boss looking. It left me wondering what the Tesla Cybertruck could have looked like had it been designed by someone who actually likes cars and wasn’t so obsessed with preparing for the end times.\n\nObviously, the production version won’t look anything like this. But even if the final result retains 20 percent of the design, it will still be a worthy addition to Honda’s lineup. The Saloon concept harkens back to the 1980s and ’90s when Honda was driving innovation in the auto industry with wraparound dashboards and four-wheel steering. Honda’s EV output has been pretty disappointing to date, so let’s hope this car signals a fresh start. — Andrew J. Hawkins \n\nBest audio product\n\nSamsung Music Frame\n\n[Image: Samsung’s Music Frame. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1bdCsCluvv8HhNB87jlHo55Omtg=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25210967/DSCF6015.jpg]\n\nThe success of Samsung’s The Frame TV makes it clear that there’s a growing contingent of consumers who are tired of their TVs looking like gadgets. This year, the company is expanding its focus on so-called invisible tech to include audio with the new Music Frame. It’s a smaller, squarer take on the Ikea / Sonos Symfonisk picture frame speaker, but the general idea is the same. You can choose between different art pieces or photographs that go on the front cover of the Music Frame to camouflage its drivers and audio components from view. If you’ve got a Samsung TV, the Music Frame can be integrated with its sound system. Or you can just use it like any other speaker — albeit with a touch of style that most wireless speakers lack. — Chris Welch\n\nBest gadget\n\nRabbit R1\n\n[Image: The Rabbit R1. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bByccLpelCtx7b91m-WvHv56_vM=/0x0:2880x2233/2880x2233/filters:focal(1440x1117:1441x1118)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212782/rabbit_r1_front.jpg]\n\nThe Rabbit R1 wasn’t on the CES show floor — it launched in a small meeting room at the very, very back of the Wynn casino. But the $199 gizmo quickly became the talk of the show, both because it is a hugely ambitious and unusual take on an AI gadget and because it’s just a stupendously nice-looking device. Something about Teenage Engineering’s design work just makes you want to touch the thing, you know? Rabbit’s vision also feels like the right one: a fun, whimsical AI assistant that can help you do all kinds of things without ever needing your phone. We have a lot of questions about how it all works — and the privacy policy — but Rabbit’s take on AI hardware might be the best we’ve seen yet. — David Pierce\n\nBest in show\n\nLG Signature OLED T\n\n[Media: https://www.instagram.com/p/C10vZ2rMjUx/]\n\nMy jaw was on the floor when I saw our video of LG’s transparent television, the LG Signature OLED T. It’s a stunning piece of technology — you can watch movies on it and make it into a convincing, virtual fish tank! But best of all, it’s no concept: it’s going to be a real product that LG actually ships sometime this year.\n\nSure, the TV is probably going to have a price tag that I’ll never be able to afford. But my favorite CES products are the ones that look like science fiction come to life and are things that actually come to market, which is why it was easy to award LG’s Signature OLED T The Verge’s Best in Show for 2024. — Jay Peters\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"CES 2024: Verge Video’s best of awards","alternativeHeadline":"Rounding up the best tech news to come out of Las Vegas.","datePublished":"2024-01-12T20:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-12T20:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24026787/ces-best-of-samsung-ballie-lg-tv","author":[],"articleBody":"The Consumer Electronics Show brings thousands of visitors to Las Vegas every year to witness the latest innovations in tech — some practical and some jaw-dropping.\n\nOur staff was on the ground, surrounded by thousands of smart rings, vacuums, concept cars, and everything in between.

It was a pivotal year for the smart home standard, as big names like Samsung, GE, and Amazon promised better interoperability between their devices and a world of sensors, appliances, and accessories. But that promise largely started and ended with smart home tech.\n\nThis year, things were a little different at CES: the idea of making products work nicely across ecosystems bled into other areas of the showcase and rippled across a range of different devices — even putting rivals on the same page to better serve users.\n\nGoogle, for instance, revealed several updates to Android that show a clear push toward interoperability. One of Google’s biggest updates was to Nearby Share, the Android equivalent of AirDrop that lets users share files with other devices that are close by. Instead of going it alone, Google announced that it’s combined Nearby Share with Samsung’s own take on the feature, called Quick Share. The newly merged sharing system will adopt Samsung’s Quick Share label and bring the “best” of both companies’ “sharing solutions together into a singular cross-Android solution,” according to Google. That should make it easier to share files across both Samsung and Pixel devices.\n\nThat’s not all for big tech brands. Samsung is expanding on its partnership with Microsoft, enabling Galaxy owners to use their phones as a webcam in the Microsoft Teams apps. LG is bringing Android’s Quick Share to Windows PCs as a preinstalled app. And LG’s TVs are adding Chromecast built in, letting users cast content from their mobile devices and use their phones as remotes. These are all small steps, but they’re examples of companies working with sometimes-competitors to make experiences that are simply better for users.\n\nAmazon is pushing ahead with an even bolder attempt to make apps and devices interoperable. It adopted the open Matter Casting protocol, a standard that aims to make video casting available from all devices. Instead of making the feature dependent on specific hardware, it only requires that the app users are casting from, and the app on the device they want to cast to, support Matter Casting. For now, the move only allows users to cast Prime Video content from their phone to the Echo Show 15, but it will soon support Fire TVs, including those made by Panasonic. Other streaming apps like Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, Starz, and ZDF are also working on adding support.\n\n\"Perhaps the most significant shift toward interoperability at CES was the widespread support for Qi2.\"\n\nBut perhaps the most significant shift toward interoperability at CES was the widespread support for Qi2: the charging standard that could finally allow both Android phones and iPhones to wirelessly charge with the same chargers at the same 15W rate. Things are still early — only the iPhone 13, 14, and 15 support the standard so far. However, Qi2-compatible Android devices are bound to show up soon, and many Android phone cases already come with magnetic charging support. Qi2 will allow both iPhone and (eventually) Android users to take advantage of more powerful wireless charging capabilities without paying Apple for a MagSafe charger, the tech on which the Qi2 standard is based. The first Qi2 chargers from Belkin, Anker, and Satechi have already made appearances at CES, giving users a lot of options to start. \n\nAlthough the theme of interoperability extended beyond the smart home this year, that doesn’t mean there weren’t any significant updates to home tech. The Home Connectivity Alliance, which is backed by companies like LG and Samsung, launched a new Energy Management Interface Specification. It’s supposed to make it easier for users to connect their devices to the energy-saving smart grid, no matter the brand. \n\nAll of these small strides toward interoperability are promising, but many still leave space where other companies need to get on board to help. It’s hard to see Apple implementing Matter Casting on its native apps, for example, and one might even argue that the new standard just complicates things since we already have two widespread (albeit proprietary) options, Chromecast and AirPlay. That reality is always lingering behind the utopian facade exuded by CES, but it was still nice to finally see more tech rivals come together under one roof — and not just on the same show floor.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"I can confirm GeForce Now works better with new G-Sync support.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-12T18:40:39.320Z","dateModified":"2024-01-12T18:40:39.320Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24036146/i-can-confirm-geforce-now-works-better-with-new-g-sync-support","author":[],"articleBody":"The service will soon support Nvidia-blessed VRR monitors, and — if your game’s running  above 40fps but struggling to hit 60 — it helps!

Can you even tell?","alternativeHeadline":"CES saw the launch of several 360Hz and even 480Hz OLED monitors.

While LCD monitors have been pushing 500Hz for around a year now, CES 2024 saw similarly excessive refresh rates arrive on their OLED siblings, with multiple monitors hitting speeds of 360 and 480Hz.\n\nWhenever we’ve written about these monitors, commenters have quite fairly asked what the point of this all is. After all, it wouldn’t be the first time manufacturers have battled over specs with debatable benefit to customers, whether that’s the “megahertz myth” or megapixel wars of the ‘00s or, more recently, smartphone display resolution. \n\n[Image: Asus’ CES 2024 monitor lineup. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YSOvSNLccWswI9mXsk1XXD5x_CQ=/0x0:2358x1104/2358x1104/filters:focal(1179x552:1180x553)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213061/Screenshot_2024_01_08_at_6.12.13_PM.png]\n\nIt wasn’t just one or two manufacturers that had such high refresh rate OLEDs to show off. Samsung, Dell, and MSI all revealed 27-inch monitors that run 1440p resolutions at 360Hz. Asus one-upped them with a 480Hz 27-inch monitor. And both LG and Asus unveiled 32-inch “Dual-Hz” displays, which offer 240Hz 4K as standard but can boost to 480Hz if you’re happy to put up with a lower 1080p resolution.\n\nAlthough these new OLED monitors aren’t hitting quite the same refresh rates as the fastest LCDs, in practice, OLED’s faster pixel response times mean that they’re likely to have better motion clarity all the same. In a video comparing a 240Hz Asus OLED monitor with a 360Hz Asus LCD last year, YouTuber Optimum points out that the LCD monitor had more ghosting despite its higher refresh rate, and the two monitors were pretty evenly matched on motion blur despite the differences in refresh rate. Blur Busters’ Mark Rejhon reckons that, on a Hz-for-Hz basis, OLED has roughly a 1.5x to 2x advantage over LCD when it comes to motion blur. The refresh rates might not be higher, but these monitors are likely to be breaking new ground all the same.\n\nWhen people ask “what’s the point?” I think they’re asking at least two interrelated questions. First is whether it’s possible to objectively measure a difference from a higher refresh rate monitor. But second is whether you’re likely to subjectively notice and actually benefit from these kinds of differences. For example, is someone playing a multiplayer game going to gain a competitive advantage at these kinds of frame rates?\n\nAccording to Blur Busters, we’ve got a long way to go before improvements to refresh rate stop making an objective difference. You can read an in-depth breakdown of the reasoning in this post in which they argue that we’ll have to go beyond 1000Hz refresh rates before screens can reduce flicker and motion blur to a level approaching the real world. This video from Monitors Unboxed does a great job at showing why motion blur can still exist on a monitor with a refresh rate over 500Hz.\n\n[Media: https://youtu.be/OV7EMnkTsYA?si=LDwBj3C7zfgDKNsY]\n\nBut using test patterns and cameras to objectively measure motion blur is one thing. It’s quite another to actually notice these kinds of benefits with our own eyes. Higher refresh rate monitors might be smoother, with better visual clarity and lower input latency for gamers — but at what point does it stop making sense to pay the price premium they carry, or prioritize them over other features like brightness?\n\nFour years ago, questions about the benefits of high refresh rate monitors were already widespread enough that Linus Tech Tips attempted to test whether even 240Hz monitors were hitting a point of diminishing returns for gamers. Their findings were nuanced, but they suggested that the benefits had yet to level off in real-world use. “I wasn’t surprised to find out that 60 fps gamers are at a significant disadvantage compared to high refresh rate gamers, but I was surprised at how big the difference was between 144 and 240[Hz],” host Linus Sebastian said. And for what it’s worth, Optimum more recently argued that he can feel a difference with even 540Hz in practice.\n\nAll of this also assumes that you’ve got the hardware to play games at these kinds of frame rates, and that you’re not tempted to sacrifice them in the name of turning on some visual eye candy. For the foreseeable future, that likely means that the only players who’ll be making the most of 360Hz or 480Hz monitors are competitive gamers playing esports titles like Counter-Strike where every frame matters. For me, a person who was happy to play through a game like Alan Wake 2 at between 40 and 60fps for the sake of enjoying its ray-traced graphics options, that’s never likely to be the case.\n\n[Image: Samsung’s Odyssey OLED G6, which also features a 360Hz refresh rate. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUiN2flknQmowxcGxCs5wagT0q8=/0x0:2400x1600/2400x1600/filters:focal(1200x800:1201x801)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25200625/CES_2024_Odyssey_OLED_G6_G60SD_2_scaled.jpg]\n\nAlthough early hands-on coverage of MSI and Alienware’s 360Hz OLED monitors from the likes of Optimum and Linus Tech Tips has been positive, when it comes time for people to decide how to spend their own money, I suspect the vast majority of people are going to be using monitors with much lower refresh rates for the foreseeable future. I can appreciate the engineering that’s gone into making it happen. But even as a person who’s been enjoying watching the monitor spec arms race from afar, I’m not looking to imminently replace my 100Hz ultrawide LCD, which I’ve been using daily for over half a decade.\n\nBut even if you don’t immediately feel the difference, it’s amazing what you can get used to over time and then immediately notice when it’s gone. I wouldn’t say I immediately noticed the difference when I used a 120Hz iPhone for the first time, but after using one almost daily for over a year, I immediately feel it when I have to use an older model. My colleague Tom Warren feels the same going back to a 120Hz after getting used to 240Hz PC monitor. It’s like going back to non-fiber 80Mbps after getting used to gigabit. Or, to use an even sillier example, it’s like drinking bad coffee after a pandemic spent obsessing over brewing the perfect cup at home.\n\nImprovements to TV and monitor technology can feel incremental in the moment, but they can stack up over time. I have consistently found myself looking at new generations of display technology and wondering how things could look any better, only to look back at those same 1080p and early 4K screens years later and see how dated they’ve become as technology has moved on.\n\nI don’t know that anyone truly “needs” to spend the money on a 360Hz or 480Hz OLED monitor. But as prices come down and the technology improves, I suspect we’ll see more and more people end up with them without thinking too much of it. And I can’t wait to find out if we’ll ever look back at 240Hz the way we now look at 60Hz monitors.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"CES 2024: the best cars and gadgets, from Rabbit to Ballie to Honda","alternativeHeadline":"On this episode of The Vergecast, we talk gadgets and cars and car gadgets and gadget cars.","datePublished":"2024-01-12T17:03:38.195Z","dateModified":"2024-01-12T17:03:38.195Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24035283/rabbit-r1-ballie-honda-zero-best-gadgets-ces-2024-vergecast","author":[],"articleBody":"The best gadgets at CES are the ones you’d never see coming.

This year, the one that caught my eye was The Handy, an automated masturbator — mainly because it was moving in a way I don’t expect to see in polite company, let alone a public show floor. But right next to it was the Oh!, a $149.95 toy coming later this spring that had me also saying “Oh?”\n\nBoth sex toys are made by Norwegian sex tech company Ohdoki. The Handy, a motorized device that moves up and down to mimic masturbation for people with penises, is certainly the flashier of the two. At a glance, the Oh! is unassuming as far as vibrators go. What makes it different is how it vibrates.\n\nMost vibrators are simple unbalanced motors attached to circuit boards and batteries, encased in a cylinder. Instead, the Oh! uses the same linear resonant actuator (LRA) motor as a PlayStation controller. LRA motors work similarly to how speakers create sound waves and are ideal for creating haptic feedback. That enables the user to control both the frequency and amplitude of the vibrations. Frequency refers to how fast the Oh! vibrates, while amplitude controls the intensity. That means instead of preset patterns, you can create your own custom vibrations along these two dimensions. (You can visualize how this works more clearly in the video below.)\n\n[Media: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1-VFp4vGxS/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\u0026igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==]\n\nAnother unique thing about Oh! is that it can be used with various content platforms. At the booth, the Oh! vibrators were paired to Spotify and if you held it up to your ear, you could hear the song that was playing and feel the Oh! vibrate in sync with the music. During my demo, I could both hear a thumpy Kylie Minogue dance track and can confirm the Oh! was buzzing along to the bass. When the beat dropped, the Oh! buzzed with everything it had. Basically, the Oh! is a vibrator powered by sound waves. \n\nAs for why you might want to do that, well, one suggestion from Ohdoki CEO and co-founder J.P. Wilhelmsen was creating your very own bow chicka wow wow playlist. Another use case might be for a more immersive experience for those who like to view adult content in VR. \n\nThis is part of Ohdoki’s attempts to build out its very own Handyverse, says Wilhemsen. “What we do is we sell the hardware and accessories, and then we provide the platform and IoT infrastructure for partners to connect through our APIs.” He then pointed to the company’s partnership with Naughty America, an adult content site. Naughty America can make content, then through the API, make that content interactive by syncing it with either The Handy or Oh!. \n\n[Image: The Oh! can also work with The Handy. Both are also going to be compatible with the Handyverse. These are sentences I wrote. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x0e8CTi_xMJAHfNr6IfSy-yCx0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220670/handyoh.jpg]\n\nOh! can also work interactively with The Handy. Both devices can also be controlled remotely to help long-distance couples stay connected, or help someone with limited dexterity or mobility use the devices. \n\nBut all of this raises the eternal question with the Internet of Dongs: privacy.\n\n“We don’t gather any personal data and we’re bound by the European GDPR regulations,” Wilhemsen told me. “The only thing we track is basically the connections. So for example, last month, we had over one and a half million online sessions.” \n\nWilhemsen further clarified that both The Handy and Oh! connect to your phone via Bluetooth but claims that no personal data is collected or sent to any servers. You’re not required to create any sort of account to use the device, either. However, if you want to use either sex toy in the Handyverse, you must then also agree to that third party’s terms and services. Those partners might collect your personal information, but this is par for the course with any health tech gadget and API integration. \n\n[Image: You can get it in black or white. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YF5tiO6Je1bsL5Mw9WzYnEmKNo0=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220674/oh2.jpg]\n\nPerhaps the thing I appreciated most was how visiting Ohdoki’s booth felt like any other on the show floor. (Well, maybe a bit more lively.) Sex tech has had a rocky history at CES, particularly in 2019 when the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) gave then rescinded an innovation award from Lora DiCarlo for its Osé sex toy. The CTA later reversed its decision after significant backlash, and the following year made a point of creating an entire section dedicated to sex tech on the show floor. Sex tech’s presence at the show in the years since has waxed and waned, especially during the virtual years. But all anyone in the sex tech industry was asking for was to be treated like any other tech company. At least at Ohdoki’s booth, that felt broadly true. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Apple won the CES headset game without showing up","alternativeHeadline":"The Vision Pro wasn’t at CES, but it had a huge presence anyway.","datePublished":"2024-01-12T14:30:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-12T14:30:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24035028/apple-vision-pro-ces-headset-game","author":[],"articleBody":"Apple isn’t at CES, but it had a huge presence anyway. On Monday, just before a string of CES keynotes were set to kick off, the company announced that its Vision Pro headset would be launching on February 2nd. Apple had already promised that the headset would launch early this year. So the stage was set for its rivals to compete by making CES 2024 a showcase of new ideas about virtual and augmented reality.\n\nUltimately, that didn’t pan out. Lots of companies showed up with AR and VR tech. A lot of the headsets offered similar functionality to the Vision Pro, like an AR / VR monitor for your computer or a substitute TV. But none were as impressive a package as Apple’s headset, nor were most arriving nearly as soon.\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GM8-H5phebzBUfvIaORwsZFNp9c=/0x0:5568x3712/5568x3712/filters:focal(2784x1856:2785x1857)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24704593/DSC_0924.jpg]\n\nThat’s not to say what was shown at CES wasn’t interesting:\n\n* Xreal revealed the $699 Air 2 Ultra glasses, which let you run augmented reality apps in addition to being able to use the glasses as a screen for a computer or mobile device.\n* TCL announced an updated and lighter version of its RayNeo X2 AR glasses, though they aren’t set to launch until Q3.\n* Asus showed off its AirVision M1 glasses, but didn’t say how much they’d cost.\n* Sony, which just released a good VR headset last year, announced a “spatial” VR headset that’s designed to help creators make 3D content.  \n* Netflix released clips hyping up 3 Body Problem, a show that prominently features a VR headset.\n* Heck, Samsung even showed off a monitor that lets you play VR games.\n\nQualcomm made some noise on the VR chip front at CES, too. Its new Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 chipset for mixed reality devices is inside Sony’s new device and is expected to power Samsung and Google’s rumored headset, though that headset didn’t appear at CES and is rumored to launch late this year. Xreal and Qualcomm announced that they’d be partnering up. And Qualcomm worked with Goertek on a reference design with 4K resolution per eye.\n\nSo it’s possible Vision Pro-style competitors could be in the works, but they’re clearly not here today. And Apple, at least right now, is operating in its own lane. It appears to excel at creating very good passthrough AR / VR hardware, and it’s hoping that developers will use that and its software development tools to create great apps. (Whether or not that makes “spatial computing” happen remains to be seen.) It also has a fully featured product that is shipping in just a few weeks, even if there may not be many Vision Pros available at the start.\n\nThat said, Apple is betting on the extreme high end with the Vision Pro. The device has dual 4K displays on the inside, an external display just for social cues, Apple’s M2 chip, and a bunch of cameras and sensors for tracking the wearer and the world around them, all packed into a sleek-looking headset. It comes with a big price to match: the Vision Pro costs $3,499, and since Apple says that’s a “starting” price, I suspect there will be more expensive versions you can buy with things like more storage.\n\n\"The Apple-sized gorilla\"\n\nIt’s not clear why the other companies at CES didn’t try for something that competed more directly with Apple, but I can think of a few possible reasons. There’s the obvious one that everyone just wanted to avoid the Apple-sized gorilla — why vie for the top of the market when you can experiment with more novel or more futuristic ideas at a fraction of the cost and pain? And I’d bet some of the companies involved simply couldn’t devote the sheer amount of time and money to high-end hardware that Apple does. \n\nIt’s also possible that the tech industry has watched other attempts at similarly big swings and decided the effort isn’t worth it. Meta, for example, launched the Quest Pro at $1,499 in 2022 but gave it a major price cut just a few months after launch. (The recently launched Quest 3 is quite good, but it’s not as top-of-the-line as the Vision Pro.) The future of the Quest Pro line is murky; Alex Heath reported last year in Command Line that Meta had decided to “can a planned second generation of the recent Quest Pro headset,” but a report a few months later indicated the company might be teaming up with LG for a new version. Meanwhile, Microsoft reportedly canceled an in-development HoloLens 3 and recently discontinued its Windows Mixed Reality platform.\n\nApple has its work cut out for it. The Vision Pro is expensive. It still looks weird when it’s strapped to someone’s face, despite Apple’s attempts to make it seem cool. And it’s not clear if the Vision Pro will, in the long run, offer anything meaningfully different from other headsets (or computers) to make it worth the exorbitant price. Yet for now, Apple has the lane it picked with the Vision Pro largely to itself — win or lose.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"This might be the year of the smart ring","alternativeHeadline":"I saw more smart rings on the CES show floor than I have in years.

After what I saw on the CES show floor, it’s about to get some real competition.\n\nThe smart ring is a promising form factor, but it’s tricky to get right. It’s more discreet and comfortable for sleep tracking than a smartwatch. The underside of your finger is also a better place to take heart rate and blood oxygen readings than your wrist. The downside is that it’s challenging to create a device that’s stylish given how small and flexible the components need to be. Plus, they tend to be pricey, with fewer features than a smartwatch.\n\nThere are all reasons why I was surprised to see several working prototypes and products at CES. I genuinely can’t remember the last time that happened.\n\n[Image: The Evie Ring is expected to ship this month. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VN-UYZs_Al-mhLeE3QTPKtx_nSs=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212486/eviering1.jpg]\n\nThe closest to launch is Movano’s Evie Ring. It first showed up at CES in 2022, and I’ve since watched it evolve from a concept to a bona fide product that will launch later this month. It’ll cost $269 and was designed to be a women-first wearable. (Though the company has told me multiple times that anyone can wear one if they want.) It’ll feature a simplified app that contextualizes data, while tracking health metrics like blood oxygen, heart rate, activity, and menstrual cycles. The goal is to eventually incorporate AI-powered insights. It looks nice and features a clever design that allows the ring to flex when your fingers are swollen. \n\nThat sounds an awful lot like what the Oura Ring does and then some. Plus, Movano is taking the extra step to get FDA clearance for the device. Not because the included features require it, but because it wants to show customers just how much care has gone into ensuring the accuracy of the sensors. \n\n[Image: The Amazfit Helio Ring is slated to launch in spring 2024. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VLK7BpV_u-YgNHbfFjokstTeo3s=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220413/amazfithelio.jpg]\n\nIt’s not just the Evie Ring, either. I also saw a prototype of the Amazfit Helio Ring. This smart ring is geared toward athletes who want greater insight into recovery. Again, a familiar premise as the Oura Ring is also a recovery tracker. It includes a daily readiness score and the ability to use it with other Amazfit smartwatches. Meaning, you could wear the smartwatch during the day and safely take it off when it’s time for bed, knowing the ring will take care of sleep tracking. Plus, it has an EDA sensor to track stress and access to an AI chatbot. \n\nThe other thing about Amazfit: it makes impressive budget wearables. I’ve tested several of its devices over the years and have been flabbergasted at how many features you get for the price. Case in point, the $200 Amazfit GTR 4 is our current pick for best overall fitness tracker. The Helio Ring doesn’t have a price yet, but judging by every other Amazfit product? When it arrives this spring, it’ll be competitively priced. \n\n[Image: The Zikr Ring is meant to help remind Muslims when to pray. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vAorMXwilNa2qQGdfend48UjlV0=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220441/zikr.jpg]\n\nThose are just the two that I find most compelling. I saw plenty others, some of which were more niche or made dubious health tracking claims. Another that stood out was the Zikr Ring — a smart ring for Muslims. The ring provides five daily reminders when it’s time to pray and has a digital tasbih counter. There was also RingConn, yet another smart ring with similar features to the Oura Ring for a slightly more affordable price. (Albeit from a less proven company.) There were more, but at a certain point the rest started to blend together.\n\nGranted, smart rings never completely went away. The Motiv Ring may have crashed and burned, but smaller companies like Ultrahuman and Circular have been tinkering away for a while now. Samsung is also rumored to be working on a Galaxy Ring. It’s more that seeing so many smart rings in one place hammered home that this space is picking up momentum. It’s only a matter of time before a smart ring meaningfully challenges Oura’s dominance. And you know what? It’s not even a matter of besting the Oura Ring. It’s more that this space has been too quiet for far too long — and a lil competition might just be what it needs to push forward. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"I rode in a Hyundai Ioniq 5 with wheels that go sideways","alternativeHeadline":"Hyundai’s Mobis e-Corner System might come to a car near you by the end of the decade.","datePublished":"2024-01-12T11:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-12T11:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24035050/hyundai-mobis-e-corner-system-ioniq-5-crab-drive-360","author":[],"articleBody":"When I was a boy, I wanted a Ferrari Testarossa. As a teen, I’d have told you James Bond’s tricked-out Aston Martin DB5 would be my ride of choice. Today, I have a new answer: a Hyundai Ioniq 5 with magic wheels that turn sideways. \n\nBecause when you have four wheels that turn sideways, dear reader, tantalizing possibilities unfold. \n\n* Effortless parallel parking because you can simply slide sideways into a spot! \n* Never having to back up in a parking lot because you can simply spin around. \n* Never having to correct your parking in a standard parking spot — because the butt of your vehicle can slide out faster than the front for (theoretically) a perfect entrance every time. \n* Diagonal driving to dodge obstacles without swerving, or switch lanes without body roll. \n\n[Media: https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7322647117216943390?lang=en]\n\nAre you skeptical? I’m skeptical! But far less skeptical than I was before I took the Hyundai Mobis e-Corner System for a ride at CES 2024.\n\nThey didn’t let me drive the car, but I sat in the front passenger seat and watched the whole operation. My driver pressed a button on a touchscreen tablet corresponding to his fancy maneuver of choice: “Crab Driving” to go sideways, “Zero Turn” to spin in place, “Pivot Turn” to slide out the rear in a controlled drift, and so on. The driver doesn’t have to steer each wheel individually, it’s computer controlled, and it looked as effortless within the cabin as it did outside.\n\nWouldn’t you accidentally hit someone this way? It certainly seems like a possibility, but Hyundai Mobis is imagining cars will contain additional cameras, sensors, and even projectors to warn others how your car is moving. \n\n[Image: The projection system paints flashing arrows on the ground to warn others that your car is spinning. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WlT6Cw-HKpXMTV5vuV5wZomvlLM=/0x0:601x385/601x385/filters:focal(301x193:302x194):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220426/hyundai_mobis_ioniq_5_e_corner.gif]\n\nIn case it’s not obvious, what’s happening here is that each wheel mechanically operates independently from the rest. There are no axles, no steering linkage, no shared motors — each wheel has its own independent drive motor, steering motor, suspension, and brakes. It’s all linked up electronically with a steer-by-wire system, with a computer rotating each miniature steering column and spinning each wheel the proper amount for the turn you’re trying to make. \n\n[Image: The electric steering system, with its own independent suspension. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UH27XiPeSb6lu91omaUM_z5bbPY=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220633/ioniq_5_hyundai_mobis_wheel_3.jpg]\n\nAll of which means this isn’t a system you’re ever going to see on a gasoline vehicle — it’s exclusively for EVs, which don’t need axles to transfer their power from an internal combustion engine. \n\nBut axles still have their uses. The normal Hyundai Ioniq 5 still has them, for example, and you can fit a much bigger electric motor around an axle than you can fit inside a wheel. \n\nThat may be one reason why Lee Seung-hwan, VP and head of advanced engineering at Hyundai Mobis, says we shouldn’t expect to see this tech in a sports car. He admits that one of the system’s weaknesses is high speed, that it’s not something you’d find in a car expected to go 200 or 300 kilometers per hour (120–185mph). In fact, he says it’s only been tested up to a maximum of 80 kilometers per hour so far, or around 50mph. \n\n[Image: Here’s a closer look, showing more of what’s inside the wheel. Tap here to enhance. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m_b-M4Jlju2eKSHUL-v_5UcltiE=/0x0:1728x3072/1728x3072/filters:focal(864x1536:865x1537)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25220631/ioniq_5_hyundai_mobis_wheel_7.jpg]\n\nBut he says he still has a couple of years to bring it to market, and the hope is to bring it close to South Korea’s current maximum highway speed of 110 kilometers per hour (68mph).\n\nWhat about battery life? Tire wear? Surprisingly, Lee and company say they aren’t major concerns — they’re expecting slight additional tread wear, but say “battery usage is in the general range” despite the additional motors. \n\nThe bigger surprise is price: “I don’t think price of this system would be much higher than the ordinary system,” Lee tells us. He wouldn’t speculate at a number, but after much prodding he maintained that it would only cost a slight premium.\n\nHyundai isn’t committing to build this car itself. Its subsidiary Hyundai Mobis is an automotive supplier that hopes to sell this tech to automakers globally beginning in 2026. Lee guesses it would take two to three years after that to see it on the road.\n\nCan we have this by the end of the decade, then? I sincerely hope so. I do think it’s going to be difficult for many automakers to intentionally sell a slower car in exchange for a system like this — but it would be the reason to buy such a car for people like me. \n\nHeck, Sony’s Afeela electric car could badly use something as obviously desirable as this.\n\n[Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZTj5uEzAK8]\n\nPhotography and video clips by Sean Hollister / The Verge\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Watch this tongue-operated retainer control a phone.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-12T09:44:43.459Z","dateModified":"2024-01-12T09:44:43.459Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24035621/watch-this-tongue-operated-retainer-control-a-phone","author":[],"articleBody":"This is the first public demonstration of Augmental’s retainer-like MouthPad accessibility gadget.

A third batch is now available with an expected delivery date between May and June of 2024.\n\nRabbit introduced the R1 during CES on Tuesday, which comes with a small 2.88-inch touchscreen that runs on the company’s own Rabbit OS. It uses a “Large Action Model” that works as a “sort of universal controller for apps,” according to my colleague David Pierce, who got to try out the device during the showcase. This allows it to do things like play music, buy groceries, and send messages through a single interface without having to use your phone. It also lets you train the device how to interact with a certain app.\n\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hCAfaNFMxj36PNdjuVbhGw4s2xY=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214893/videoframe_858490.png]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DnSWtsVF7DVjL8Gk0zaI6h1Szm0=/0x0:4032x3024/4032x3024/filters:focal(2016x1512:2017x1513)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214919/IMG_6029.JPG]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cyIOXElLo7Z7uk7xcBefQeYqIas=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214892/videoframe_787161.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xYBmc2-qpvX8uSEpmcVU8j5Ty9I=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214886/videoframe_1411744.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/73329rB5MHE2Zk2j5_jA2x2X2Yg=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214888/videoframe_1391131.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QT6VqxlFSYYzasBHnhHtAzG-js4=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214889/videoframe_1046683.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eC5OLEkb2k8mvJ4_N7MqVo_22aI=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214890/videoframe_957848.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XqLEt9ga4Hx9npN2EnQ6NK86BFA=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214891/videoframe_811931.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bfrgKlNu8vlCTL66b-MmJy3v5lA=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214883/videoframe_701592.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nt3ebiAoA4GXECDoDs2ylNat6hw=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214884/videoframe_1509155.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6-2GPnHCx9M5wDfhUC_ydM_gwvE=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214885/videoframe_1514599.png]\n\nUpdate January 11th, 7:21PM ET: Rabbit has sold out of its second batch of R1 devices and put a third batch up for preorder.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"The Rabbit R1 is selling quick as a bunny.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-12T00:18:46.071Z","dateModified":"2024-01-12T00:18:46.071Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24035268/the-rabbit-r1-is-selling-quick-as-a-bunny","author":[],"articleBody":"The company announced it sold out of its second round of 10,000 devices, 24 hours after the first batch sold out and barely 48 since it launched to the world.

That’s why it was refreshing to see Dexcom roll up to CES 2024 to talk about something a bit more tangible: its forthcoming Stelo continuous glucose monitor (CGM), a wearable sensor that provides a real-time look at your blood sugar levels. Unlike most CGMs, the Stelo is specifically designed to be an affordable option for Type 2 diabetics who don’t use insulin. \n\nUnlike Type 1 diabetes, where a person produces little to no insulin, Type 2 diabetes is when, over time, the body either doesn’t produce enough insulin or the body becomes insulin resistant. Roughly 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed diabetics have Type 2. However, if they control their glucose levels through oral medication rather than inject insulin, they usually don’t have access to CGM devices.\n\n“The way CGMs work in the US is that coverage is pretty good if you take insulin, and that’s about a third of people with Type 2 diabetes,” says Dexcom COO Jake Leach. “But there’s this large portion of about 25 million people who don’t have insurance coverage for CGMs and there really hasn’t been a product designed for them.” \n\nAccording to Leach, the Stelo is based on Dexcom’s existing G7 CGM platform and will last for about 15 days per sensor. However, instead of a system that centers around low blood sugar alerts — which is most useful for those who use insulin — the Stelo app is meant to provide insights around real-time readings. In other words, this isn’t a device meant to save lives, but rather improve them. \n\nFor example, Leach says, the hope is that through using Stelo, Type 2 diabetics who don’t regularly check their blood sugar with finger prick tests can come away with a greater understanding of what their normal average blood glucose range looks like, and what to do with that data. For example, they might learn that pairing white rice with chicken and vegetables at dinner leads to a lower spike than rice eaten alone. Or that the same foods eaten earlier in the night result in a less intense glucose response. Ideally, that would empower them to make smarter choices day to day between doctor visits. \n\n[Image: This isn’t the exact Stelo CGM, but it will be based on Dexcom’s G7 platform. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSUNiYnWDhqtYpbtFJ3jexUnpgw=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25219921/IMG_3067.jpg]\n\nIt’s similar to pitches from other CGM startups that tout using these devices for athletes or the uber health conscious. But while Leach sees the opportunities for CGMs for non-diabetics, he says Dexcom is choosing to stay focused on expanding use cases for those with diabetes. \n\n“Everyone who has a CGM that I’ve talked to learns something about their diet that they didn’t know that was unexpected,” says Leach. “CGMs are tools that can help you understand, but in order for them to be successful in helping people, it’s got to be properly designed for that group.”\n\nLeach has a point. Last year, I tested the Nutrisense CGM, and while I definitely learned things about myself, there wasn’t a reason for me, a non-diabetic, to keep wearing one long term. Meanwhile, blood glucose tech at CES can be a wild, directionless hodgepodge. When trawling the show floor, not everyone has a good answer when I ask about regulatory clearance, timelines, who exactly this tech is meant to help, and what problems they’re trying to solve.\n\n[Image: This is the Dexcom CGM applicator. It features a flexible needle, and having used a CGM, I can confirm it doesn’t hurt. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hMOfmWs9zKtFUvu5C4imySMORfo=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25219925/IMG_3070.jpg]\n\nThat’s why it’s exciting to see that Stelo has a much clearer mission statement. Dexcom is a medical device company with experience bringing this sort of tech to the market and with working with the FDA. Leach tells me that focusing on software over the last few years allows Dexcom to push frequent updates to address user feedback and needs. Right now, the Dexcom G6 and G7 connect with over 100 digital apps and Leach says the plan is make sure Stelo also has a full ecosystem available. \n\nBut the cherry on top is a commitment to accessibility. Leach didn’t give me a final price — partly because the product is not yet available, but also because insurance makes it impossible to definitively say how much anything will cost. According to Leach, most Dexcom customers pay less than $40 if their insurance covers CGMs. Medicare patients pay around $50 monthly, while a third are lucky enough to pay nothing at all. If you’re not covered, however, Dexcom CGMs can cost around $173 a month out of pocket. The Stelo is intended to come at a more competitive price for people who have to pay out of pocket. \n\nThe Stelo CGM is currently going through the FDA clearance process, with plans to launch this summer. It’s not a given that Type 2 diabetics will immediately glom onto CGMs as a form of treatment. And while Leach says physicians he’s spoken to are in favor of this tech for Type 2 diabetics, we still have to see how the medical community will incorporate this. (Wearable data, for example, isn’t always helpful to doctors.) But even so, the potential of positively impacting millions of underserved people is a noble endeavor. That’s the sort of innovative spirit you want to see at CES. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"A set of Hyundai wheels is the best thing I saw at CES.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-11T21:31:47.881Z","dateModified":"2024-01-11T21:31:47.881Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24035027/a-set-of-hyundai-wheels-is-the-best-thing-i-saw-at-ces","author":[],"articleBody":"Wheels that turn sideways to crab-walk into a parking spot. 360-degree spins so I don’t have to back up as often.

It’s about time, because router companies shoved Wi-Fi 7 routers out the door throughout 2023, and we’ve been waiting on machines that can put the standard’s ludicrous speed promises to the test.\n\nWi-Fi 7 came to gaming laptops first and foremost, and the focus on gaming makes sense. One of the biggest benefits of Wi-Fi 7 is that it allows for one device to connect to your router on multiple bands — a feature called Multi-Link Operation — which gives your laptop options when it comes to where to funnel its packets. That means that when your 5GHz band is at capacity, it’ll just send the data down the 6GHz pipe, and vice versa. The result should be lower latency when you’re on a busy network, which is critical when you’re not able to wire up with ethernet.\n\nMost of the new laptops equipped with Wi-Fi 7 are on their way very soon. But some of the earliest are, at least for now, very expensive: the 16-inch Razer Blade 16 starts at $3,000, and the 18-inch MSI Titan 18 HX A14V costs at least $5,000. (The only option up for preorder right now comes in at $9,099.) Both of those are due out in mid-January.\n\nIf you’re not in the mood to dump your life savings into a laptop, some more affordable gaming models with Wi-Fi 7 were announced, too. There’s the $2,099 Lenovo Legion 7i that’s coming in March or the much more affordable HP Omen Transcend that’s available for $1,499.99. From Dell, two Alienware gaming laptops also got the Wi-Fi 7 treatment, while the company’s well-liked XPS line got the nod in two of its three laptops: the XPS 13 and XPS 16.\n\nThe one big exception at the show to the unspoken Wi-Fi 7 gaming laptop rule appeared to be Asus. None of the laptops that the company announced in its ROG lineup, including the Zephyrus line, have Wi-Fi 7 listed in their specs. That’s surprising considering that the company was one of the first out of the gate with a Wi-Fi 7 router.\n\nIf you’re looking to upgrade your gaming laptop and you’re not the type to insist on a wired connection, now is a fine time to start looking at Wi-Fi 7 routers. There weren’t a lot announced at the show — Acer has a gaming router coming, and MSI announced a mesh system — but a few hit the market in 2023, including gamer routers from Netgear and ROG. You will probably want to be cautious about pulling the trigger, though. The choices are still a little slim and mostly still expensive.\n\nArtificial intelligence (or is that “Affectionate Intelligence”?) may have been the headliner of everything at CES 2024, but gadgets still managed to show up and speed up as always. With Wi-Fi 7, the routers were already out there, giving us the roads — now that the Wi-Fi Alliance is certifying the standard, laptops are coming to give us the cars.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Clicks hands-on: this BlackBerry-like iPhone case could be a winner","alternativeHeadline":"Just remember, though: hardware is hard","datePublished":"2024-01-11T19:00:28.936Z","dateModified":"2024-01-11T19:00:28.936Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034555/clicks-keyboard-case-iphone-hands-on","author":[],"articleBody":"Clicks came out of nowhere last week with a blast from the past — a BlackBerry-like physical keyboard for your iPhone, built into a snazzy protective case with colors that pop.

It’s from a team that knows a thing or two about keyboards, including CrackBerry Kevin, MrMobile, and the guys behind the F(x)tec phone.\n\nAs a known lapsed QWERTY devotee, I had to try it, and at CES 2024 I got my chance. \n\n[Media: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C194MZWL_vg]\n\nIt feels great in the hand, with a nice subtly squishy silicone bumper feel, and seems well thought out in general. The phone fits so securely, and I particularly love the square of leatherette around back that goes beneath your fingertips. Not only does it provide extra grip when you’re typing, it makes the iPhone look and feel a bit more like a classic camera when you hold it horizontally. \n\nYou can tap a button to activate a backlight, and there’s a dedicated Command key for shortcuts — for instance, hit Command + Spacebar and then you can just start typing in the iPhone’s Spotlight universal search without touching the screen at all. iOS lets you build additional keyboard shortcuts, too. Tapping spacebar lets you scroll websites a page at a time, and iOS autocorrect works as you’d expect.\n\nBut I do have one concern. \n\nAs you may see in the video above, Clicks brought at least four different prototypes to CES 2024, each with a different click, and I only really liked the two of them that weren’t functional yet. The functional ones were a bit stiff or sticky.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I liked those last clicks a lot — the final engineering sample of Clicks’ mechanical structure is delightfully tactile. Combine that with the bigger, wider keys you get on the Clicks for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I think it could be a winner.\n\nBut Clicks says it’s shipping the iPhone 14 Pro cases just three weeks from today, and it wasn’t able to bring final samples to CES.

I hide them in the walls behind my TV, I make them disappear around my desk, and I try to eradicate them everywhere else in my life. So every time I hear about something in the PC building community that involves hiding or removing cables, I get excited. Over the past few years, some of the biggest names in PC building have been making it easier to hide cables away and build a PC that showcases your skills.\n\nI’ve built a lot of PCs over the past 25 years, and the main part of the process I hate the most is cable management. It often takes me longer to tidy up cables and route them properly than it does to put all the parts of a PC together. It’s especially bad if you’ve decided to build a PC with a bunch of RGB fans and an all-in-one (AIO) cooler. There are more cables to hide and more lighting to reveal any mistakes you make. Thankfully, a lot has changed in recent years.\n\nCase manufacturer Lian Li helped push the PC building industry toward daisy-chained RGB fans with its Uni Fan a few years ago. Instead of two cables per fan (one for power and one for lighting), the Uni Fans connect together, so you only need to route a single cable for a block of fans. It’s a design that takes away a lot of clutter, so naturally it led to many competitors launching their own versions.\n\n[Image: The iCUE Link system makes cable management a lot easier. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LaMk6lxksfm9HN4b0wb-477zIvo=/0x0:2558x1516/2558x1516/filters:focal(1279x758:1280x759)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25218896/Panel2_iCUE_LINK_Image.png]\n\nCorsair was one of them with its iCUE Link system. Launched last year, it offers daisy-chained RGB fans and AIO coolers that hide all the cables away. Corsair has even moved all the pump AIO cables into the tubes that route to the radiator, so you don’t have to worry about trying to hide them yourself.\n\nI built a PC recently with the iCUE Link system and was surprised at how much of my cable headaches went away. I have 12 iCUE Link fans in total, with just three cables running to the rear of my Phanteks NV7 case. Without daisy-chained fans, that would be at least 24 cables to cable manage. Instead, there are the three cables and a little hub where the cables attach at the rear, which then feeds into your CPU fan header, USB, and a PCIe power connection.\n\nWhile there are plenty of daisy-chained RGB fans on the market, I think Corsair has a good balance of features and performance. The iCUE Link fans have a “Time Warp” mode that makes it look like the fans aren’t spinning by synchronizing the strobing of the LEDs with the speed of the fans. It’s a gimmick as pointless as RGB itself, but if you’re spending all this money on making your PC look pretty, then why not have strobing fans, too.\n\n[Image: Corsair’s iCUE Link fans connect together with a single cable. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSt9ds5uOAGXc2I2y2us3JeGxAY=/0x0:2560x1920/2560x1920/filters:focal(1280x960:1281x961)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25218906/daisychain.jpg]\n\nThe main iCUE app also lets you control individual lighting and fan speeds, along with reading the temperatures around a fan thanks to sensors embedded into iCUE Link fans. The LCD display on the iCUE Link AIO is also a neat way to display CPU / GPU temperatures or your favorite GIF.\n\nThe only drawback to this kind of fan system is the price. These are more expensive right now, regardless of manufacturer, and as the connectors and fans vary, you’ll likely have to plan your build out a little more. If you buy into iCUE Link, for example, then you can’t just add a Lian Li fan or Phanteks fan into the mix and have them work together in harmony because they all use different connectors. I also had to consider which way to angle Corsair’s connectors and how to daisy-chain them as there are limits to how many can chain on a single cable. But for me, that’s all still less of a hassle than routing individual power and lighting cables.\n\n[Image: MSI’s Project Zero motherboards put the connectors at the rear. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qv1LWJLPwuwwNcFrDf7gBuq612g=/0x0:2370x1246/2370x1246/filters:focal(1185x623:1186x624)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25218915/INTEL_B760M_PROJECT_ZERO.jpg.jpg]\n\nAll of this improved cable management didn’t even exist five years ago, and there’s still room for improvement. At CES this year, it looks like we might be on the verge of making it easier to hide and route all the fiddly cables you have to connect up to a motherboard. MSI launched its Project Zero motherboard in October, and now Maingear is partnering with Phanteks to modify its popular NV9 case to hide the motherboard connections and case cables.\n\nThis means the power supply connections, audio, USB, and front panel headers are all accessible at the rear. Many PC case manufacturers still ship ugly USB connectors and front panel cables that ruin a showcase PC build, so anything to hide these away is welcomed. (Also, shoutout to Phanteks and others for unifying the front panel connectors into a single block.)\n\nThis latest motherboard trend has been emerging over the past couple of years. Gigabyte also collaborated with Maingear in 2022 and launched its own Project Stealth motherboard to hide the connectors. Asus also created a “DIY-APE” set of motherboards that same year to try to push the industry toward better cable management. At CES this year, Asus even unveiled a cable-free “BTF” RTX 4090 with a new PCIe-based connector that removes the need for a 12VHWPR cable.\n\n[Image: Asus’ BTF GPU gets rid of the need for a power cable. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SKNARkQdOyvA1Bo-1x98BGZ_wc8=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/filters:focal(960x540:961x541)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25218892/advanced_btf_1_v2.jpg]\n\nThe only disappointing part of this entire movement toward better cable management is that the entire PC industry hasn’t agreed on a standard for daisy-chain fans or motherboards and GPUs that hide the cables away. And that’s all probably down to patents, competition, and a desire to lock consumers into a specific system.\n\nLian Li filed a lawsuit against Phanteks and Thermaltake, alleging that both companies’ fan designs infringe on one of Lian Li’s patents. That lawsuit is ongoing, and how it plays out will have an impact on daisy-chained fans (see Gamers Nexus’ excellent report on the lawsuit). Since the filing of that lawsuit, Lian Li has also launched a version of its Uni Fans that have 1.6-inch LCD displays built into them. I’m sure we’ll see competitors turn that into a trend, too.\n\nOn the motherboard side, Maingear also owns an “MG-RC” patent on a design for a motherboard and case with hidden internal connectors, but it has shown it’s willing to partner with PC manufacturers. “Maingear is working to standardize MG-RC among PC case and motherboard makers, aiming to drive industry-wide adoption of this technology to benefit OEMs, system builders, and consumers,” says Maingear in a press release at CES. By the end of Q1, Phanteks will have a version of its NV9 with cutouts at the rear for MSI’s latest Z790 Project Zero motherboard.\n\n[Image: Maingear’s new NV9 Zero build. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2EMICL82YoeZS4-jiOShazBmXW0=/0x0:2560x1707/2560x1707/filters:focal(1280x854:1281x855)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25218918/nv9zero.jpg]\n\nAll of these changes remind me of when power supplies went modular. The power cables still aren’t fully interoperable, but at least the industry improved that side of cable management so it was easier to swap out power cables for custom ones. Given that Corsair’s iCUE Link system is proprietary and Lian Li is filing lawsuits against competitors, it doesn’t look like an open standard will emerge for daisy-chain fans just yet.\n\nWhile it’s a mess of standards, I’m still happy that the PC industry has finally realized cable management sucks. Daisy-chained fans and new motherboard designs are now shaking up how you can build that beautiful custom PC you’ve seen your favorite YouTuber or Twitch streamer showcase.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"I don’t get the hype about the Rabbit R1.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-11T17:33:49.971Z","dateModified":"2024-01-11T17:33:49.971Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034562/i-dont-get-the-hype-about-the-rabbit-r1","author":[],"articleBody":"10,000-plus people are already sold on the big AI hit of CES 2024, but I’m not there yet.

Rather, Sony Honda wanted us to know that its car is a thumping movie theater and entertainment cockpit, despite its narrow (but impressively wide) strip of screen, and that the front bumper can help make you a rolling advertisement for Sony movies and Sony video games (not kidding) by pressing a button in its dedicated smartphone app.\n\nWe did get to briefly touch the steering wheel and open the doors, but everything else was hands-off — we were there to experience the mere feeling of being in an Afeela, and that’s all. (I would describe that feeling as “cushy neon.”)\n\n[Media: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C15zF6cs5cp/]\n\nWhile the company maintains the car will be available for preorder in 2025 and begin deliveries in 2026, it’s still not done adding to its more concept-y features, inking new partnerships with Microsoft to use Azure to create an AI “conversational personal agent” and with Gran Turismo developer Polyphony Digital to “develop vehicles that fuse the virtual and the real.” \n\nThe driver’s seat rumbled impressively while watching a Gran Turismo movie trailer; less impressively, we discovered that its ability to play PlayStation games on that strip of screen is currently just a PlayStation Remote Play connection to your PS5 at home — a PlayStation Portal on wheels.\n\nAt least, for now. Whether an actual PlayStation might appear in the car is one of the many things that’s still undecided, Sony Honda Mobility president and COO Izumi Kawanishi tells The Verge. The car’s speed and range aren’t decided yet or even the basic driving functions, though the car will be made in a Honda factory and benefit from Honda’s expertise. When I ask what keeps him up at night, Kawanishi says it’s the AI because key features like Level 3 self-driving and the personal assistant aren’t there because the AI itself isn’t finalized. \n\n[Image: A peek inside: for a fuller tour, click through our gallery near the top of this story. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r84Bg9j3upBSyqw6BYdBB49m9B8=/0x0:2040x1148/2040x1148/filters:focal(1020x574:1021x575)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25218131/sony_afeela_verge_ces_2024_017.jpg]\n\nFrom the beginning, it felt like Sony badly wanted this car to feel different than its peers, and maybe it does, but not yet in the way that Sony Honda wants. Kawanishi, a longtime Sony exec who worked on the PS3, PSP, Sony Mobile phones, and the fourth-generation Aibo, says his goal is to “contribute to the evolution of the future of mobility.” When I ask him how Afeela will do that, he says he believes the future of mobility is autonomous driving and the personal assistant — that this car needs to be intelligent. Right now, it’s not.\n\nI certainly wouldn’t mind driving a concept-y, high-tech car rather than one whose edges have all been sanded off to cater to the masses, and I suspect that’s one of the reasons Tesla has been so successful with its software-updatable vehicles — including controversial features that go too far. But Sony Honda hasn’t yet given us enough concrete reasons to want an Afeela.\n\nThe next time we slide into the cockpit, here’s hoping it won’t be a hands-off experience with a Sony Honda rep at the controls — but us driving a car that’s clever enough for both gearheads and nerds to love. \n\nPhotography by Sean Hollister / The Verge\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"We’re Verge reviewers, so of course we’re making goofy videos at CES.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-11T07:25:08.969Z","dateModified":"2024-01-11T07:25:08.969Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034151/were-verge-reviewers-so-of-course-were-making-goofy-videos-at-ces","author":[],"articleBody":"TikTok might be the trendsetter these days, but we’ve been at this a while. \n\n[Attachment: https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7322656142205783326]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"I... might actually use this Nvidia AI tool!","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-10T23:09:24.842Z","dateModified":"2024-01-10T23:09:24.842Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033551/i-might-actually-use-this-nvidia-ai-tool","author":[],"articleBody":"Nvidia’s Chat with RTX lets you train your own local chatbot with your own files for free, no cloud required.

The vehicle can be transformed from a minivan to a full-size van to a small truck, depending on the specific need. The driver cab remains fixed while the rest of the vehicle is interchangeable, like a real-life Duplo set. \n\nOne of the possible variations is the PV5, a midsized electric van that Kia says is designed for ridehailing, delivery, and utilities. Uber wants to add the PV5 as an option for its drivers, in the hopes of fulfilling its pledge to go all-electric in all markets by 2040. \n\n\"Uber wants to add the PV5 as an option for its drivers\"\n\nUber says the purpose of the deal with Kia is “to identify optimal specifications for PBV models, with the possible further integration of technology and services to benefit drivers and ride hailing users alike.” The two companies will work together on the creation of “proofs of concept, prototypes, and the production of PBVs tailored to the needs of drivers that use the Uber platform.”\n\nUber is under pressure from governments around the world to get more of its drivers into EVs to reduce tailpipe pollution and fight climate change. Of course, getting the hundreds of thousands of people who drive for Uber to switch to EVs will be no easy task. Ridehail drivers are classified as independent contractors, and many use their personal cars to drive for not just one but several gig economy companies. Uber can’t just force all its drivers to make the switch without jeopardizing their status as freelancers.\n\nConor Ferguson, a spokesperson for Uber, said the company would have more to say about financing the purchase of Kia’s PBV vehicles closer to when they are available. \n\nCurrently, Uber works with automakers to offer drivers flexible leases on EVs and incentives like added bonuses on each trip they do in an electric vehicle. Uber says it has over 74,000 drivers using electric vehicles in North America and Europe. \n\nUber previously made a deal with UK-based startup Arrival to acquire its EVs, but that company is barely staying afloat these days.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Heck yeah, an E Ink phone that makes sense.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-10T21:29:39.047Z","dateModified":"2024-01-10T21:29:39.047Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033537/heck-yeah-an-e-ink-phone-that-makes-sense","author":[],"articleBody":"Phone makers keep experimenting with ways to incorporate E Ink, from secondary displays to relying on it as the only display, but its lower refresh rate can make experiences feel hampered compared to LED and OLED.\n\nBut Infinix put E Ink’s Prism tech on the back of a phone, leading to something very customizable and very pretty. \n\n[Attachment: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wV78HwBwYm6iUTeOYlNduzIklNs=/0x184:3929x2833/3929x2649/filters:focal(631x1396:632x1397)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25217639/IMG_1766.jpeg]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"E Ink has gone from cars... to toilets?!","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-10T20:30:34.500Z","dateModified":"2024-01-10T20:30:34.500Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033463/e-ink-has-gone-from-cars-to-toilets","author":[],"articleBody":"Kohler’s got an E Ink version of its Numi 2.0 smart toilet on the show floor — and it’s got the whole Verge crew in a tizzy.

Okay, there are no birds at CES (and not many around the Las Vegas Strip, which may not be by accident), but I did get to test out the smart binos and do some twitching (of the birding kind) on the show floor. \n\nThese Marc Newson-designed Swarovski Optic AX Visio binoculars look and feel like standard high-end binos, but when I trained them on a nearby avian (actually, a cardboard cutout on the top of a wood pole), they told me its species. \n\n[Image: The AX Visio smart binoculars can identify over 9,000 species of birds and mammals for you. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cVtz6SiaZZHBSJEcqT2bh6Rk6Co=/0x0:1536x2048/1536x2048/filters:focal(768x1024:769x1025)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25216764/IMG_0287.jpeg]\n\nHere’s how: when the bird was in focus, I pressed a button, and a red circle filled in as the binoculars processed the image. Within about five seconds, the name — “American kestrel” — popped up on the screen.\n\nMost birds move fast, so five seconds felt a beat too long, but the tech, powered by an “integrated operating and object-recognition system” and onboard neural processing unit, is undeniably cool. The binoculars are 10 x 32 with a 1,000-yard field of view, and the image was crystal clear. \n\n[Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH1FvZav8wU]\n\nAs an avid wildlife watcher, I would absolutely love a pair of these — especially as they also take pictures and video with a 13MP and 1080p video camera that you can transfer wirelessly to the Swarovski Optik Outdoor app on your phone. But at $4,799, this is probably not an impulse buy. \n\nThe binoculars also have built-in GPS to help the onboard processor know the type of species you might be looking at based on your location. \n\nAnother neat feature is a “Share discoveries” function that allows arrow markers to pop up in the viewfinder so you can pass the binoculars to a friend and they can be guided to what you saw. The AX Visio will be available to buy in February.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Live demos are hard, y’all.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-10T17:27:15.506Z","dateModified":"2024-01-10T17:27:15.506Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033105/live-demos-are-hard-yall","author":[],"articleBody":"I’m in Samsung’s CES booth this morning, where I finally got to see the new Ballie robot in action.

The store brings more potential use cases to ChatGPT and expands OpenAI’s ecosystem beyond what the company builds for customers. \n\nSince announcing the GPT Builder program in November, OpenAI said more than 3 million bots — called GPTs — have been created by users. (Yours truly included; I made a GPT that suggests synonyms for common words). The company said it plans to highlight useful GPTs weekly inside the store.\n\nThe company originally planned to open the GPT Store in November before delaying it to December and finally to January. The platform lets people who’ve created their own chatbots publicly share their versions of ChatGPT. So far, only those who subscribe to OpenAI’s paid tiers can make and use custom GPTs.\n\nOpenAI also announced it will start a revenue sharing program with GPT creators in the first quarter of the year. GPT builders will be paid based on user engagement with their chatbots, but the company hasn’t shared specifics yet on what that looks like in practice.\n\nAhead of the GPT Store’s opening, OpenAI said it established a new review system to ensure custom GPTs meet its brand guidelines and usage policies. It also updated how to report GPTs users find harmful or unsafe.\n\nThe GPT Store will roll out to users of ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users, along with subscribers to a new tier called Team. \n\nChatGPT Team is a paid version of ChatGPT targeted for smaller teams of around 150 people. Like ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Team offers access to GPT-4, DALL-E 3, and OpenAI’s Advanced Data Analysis feature, and control over data. OpenAI said ChatGPT Team data and conversations will not be used to train any of its models. Subscribers to ChatGPT Team can also create custom GPTs for their teams’ specific needs or use other GPTs on the store.\n\nChatGPT Team is priced at $25 a month per user when billed annually or $30 a month per user for monthly billing. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Here are all the Wi-Fi 7 routers announced at CES this year.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-10T16:26:15.151Z","dateModified":"2024-01-10T16:26:15.151Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032950/here-are-all-the-wi-fi-7-routers-announced-at-ces-this-year","author":[],"articleBody":"There weren’t many, but most big names announced theirs last year.\n\nNew to buy are Ubiquiti’s UniFi U7 Pro PoE+ access point and several of TP-Link’s new (and some not so new) routers.

Trucks are some of the most popular vehicles in the country, and a midsize electric truck could do quite well given most of the segment is dominated by full-size ones. A small, affordable crossover like the VF3, which aims for mass-market appeal, could help folks who are on a budget go fully electric. \n\n\"Theoretically, both of these vehicles could sell really well in the US\"\n\nBut all of that is dependent on building cars people want to buy, and VinFast has had a rough time so far trying to break into the US market. Its first global vehicle, the VF8, has been called “the worst reviewed car in America.” The company recently named its founder and chief financial backer, Pham Nhat Vuong, as CEO, replacing Le Thi Thu Thuy, who had held the post since late 2021. \n\nFounded in 2017, VinFast started manufacturing EVs in 2021 and has continuously received financial support from Vuong, who is Vietnam’s richest man — most recently, a $1 billion grant in April 2023, according to Reuters. It began delivering cars in California last March, selling around 21,200 units as of the third quarter of last year. The company says it plans to build factories in the US, India, and Indonesia. \n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fsZr6v-ZO7rOF7R21l81-x2kOw=/0x0:1651x1100/1651x1100/filters:focal(826x550:827x551)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25216385/Photo_2__1_.jpg]\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bhLyqN4nbBCh2Ic7BqFL88PP4FQ=/0x0:1333x1333/1333x1333/filters:focal(667x667:668x668)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25216384/Photo_1__2_.jpg]\n\nTaking all of that into consideration, the new concepts that were displayed at CES are a sign of what’s to come from the brand. The VF Wild electric truck concept features the same wing-shaped LED lighting signature, sculpted bodies, and other styling details seen on VinFast’s other vehicles. The truck’s bed includes a power-folding midgate that expands the length from five to eight feet. No range, pricing, or production timing was provided for the VF Wild. \n\nWe similarly got limited details about the VF3, a cute two-door “mini-eSUV” for city dwellers. With a targeted range of 125 miles, the VF3 will likely fall in the same category as the Fiat 500e when it goes on sale in the US. VinFast didn’t provide timing for deliveries but said it would start to take reservations later this year. The EV could theoretically fill the gap left by discontinued small vehicles like the BMW i3 and Chevy Bolt EV. \n\nIn addition to the VF 8 and VF 9, both of which are SUVs, VinFast’s smart electric vehicle lineup comprises the VF 5, VF 6, and VF 7, all of which were designed by Pininfarina and Torino Design. \n\nVinFast will need to overcome a number of obstacles before it can establish itself as a serious contender in the EV market. VinFast stock was trading Wednesday at $6.65 apiece as of Monday, around 30 percent below its listing price and 85 percent below the closing price on its IPO day. And the company may need to go back to the drawing board before releasing these vehicles to the public — if the “abysmal” reviews of the VF8 crossover are any indication of future quality. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Another day done at CES.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-10T14:09:06.157Z","dateModified":"2024-01-10T14:09:06.157Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032785/another-day-done-at-ces","author":[],"articleBody":"The show floor only just opened yesterday, but we got a glimpse at a ton of cool new products, prototypes, and features:\n\n• Asus made a portable monitor — and a laptop — with two screens.\n\n• Sony and Honda showed off an Afeela EV prototype that puts Fortnite on your bumper.\n\n• Amazon announced Matter casting support for Prime Video.\n\n• Google and Samsung teamed up to combine Quick Share and Nearby Share into a single sharing solution.\n\n• This AI startup made a little gadget that’s supposed to use your apps for you.\n\nThere’s still more to come!

Although it’s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\n\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That’s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery’s estimates.

That results in relatively poor solar conversion efficiency for the available surface area. Jackery’s rooftop tent maximizes power generation by filling the entire roof with solar cells and then extending them outward, while also neatly integrating the wiring required to feed the Jackery power station. \n\n[Image: A closer look at the system with a portable battery that is not the Jackery E1000 Plus power station being shown at CES. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pApaC-zWhIQIRZxHMGS4RvyG524=/0x0:3500x2333/3500x2333/filters:focal(1750x1167:1751x1168)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25207621/CO3234387_1.jpg]\n\nThe CES concept tent feeds a separate 1.26kWh E1000 Plus power station, capable of 2000W of AC output. That’s enough to run a 1150W portable air conditioner for about one hour, a 60W car fridge for about 45 hours, or a 900W electric cooker for an hour — longer if you add LFP expansion batteries for up to 5kWh of total energy storage. The E1000 Plus can also be charged from the car while driving (seven hours to full) or wall jack (1.7 hours). \n\nIt’s unclear who Jackery is partnering with on the tent production. Nevertheless, the concept is fitted with a memory foam mattress, insulation, dimmable lighting with color control, and waterproof fabric with blackout windows. Jackery says that the production version will come “complete with an onboard charging module.”\n\n[Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqp2V_wEmOY]\n\nAt CES, Jackery account manager Nimesh Patel provided some more details in an interview with YouTube’s The Bearded Tesla Guy, and showed off the actual prototype which differs slightly from the rendered drawings. Notably, the prototype only has three distinct solar panels, rather than the five expandable panels shown in the renders.  Nevertheless, Patel says the shipping model will feature a 400W panel at the center of the 1000W array, with a removable power station built into the tent that’s “sleekly designed” so that it doesn’t take up too much interior space while sleeping. Jackery’s also working on making expansion kits available to add additional storage as well as an AC inverter kit to quickly charge the power station off the vehicle’s alternator while the engine is running. The tent is expected to weigh less than 200 pounds and is designed to fit as many vehicle sizes as possible, including possibly sedans.\n\n[Image: That insulation had better be good. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZoUAzFJXaF83YdK5c3AbmEDbU0s=/0x0:3500x2333/3500x2333/filters:focal(1750x1167:1751x1168)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25207623/CO3234387_3.jpg]\n\nIt’s too early to call it a trend, but I’m happy to see solar generator specialists like Jackery and EcoFlow (via its partnership with Winnebago) embrace the community of overlanders, vanlifers, and weekend warriors with fully integrated solutions that make it easy to take modern work / life comforts off the grid. \n\nAfter all, if you’re part of the new hybrid workforce, why work from your crummy urban apartment when you can work from places that inspire you instead?\n\nUpdate January 9th, 7:03AM ET: Added video of prototype from CES floor as well as details about the production version learned at the show.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Tangle-free magnetic USB-C cables just got a facelift.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-10T05:22:53.777Z","dateModified":"2024-01-10T05:22:53.777Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032563/tangle-free-magnetic-usb-c-cables-just-got-a-facelift","author":[],"articleBody":"This is the Scosche Strikeline Cobra.

Today, the company announced its AI-focused chip for the automotive sector or, as Intel describes it, “the first-generation AI-enhanced software-defined vehicle system-on-chip.” Intel also announced the acquisition of an energy management company and a new effort to standardize battery power for electric vehicles. \n\nIntel has been locked in a race with Nvidia and AMD to corner the market in processors and other hardware needed to fuel the AI boom. Now, it’s shifting to AI PCs, arguing that AI is more secure when running on a personal computer as opposed to over the internet. \n\nThe companies also compete in the automotive sector, fueled by the belief that the car is the next great software platform. Intel’s new automotive chips are designed to enhance in-car experiences, such as navigation, voice assistants, and vehicle controls, said Jack Weast, vice president and general manager of Intel Automotive. \n\n[Image: Intel’s plan for the future of the car is pretty complex. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cLl-pFivdPBdzN3F9LaET9ffWmw=/0x0:1201x629/1201x629/filters:focal(601x315:602x316)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214170/Intel_Automotive_future_architecture.jpg]\n\nThe first company to sign up to install these chips in its vehicles is Zeekr, the EV subbrand of China’s Geely. (Geely is also the parent company of Volvo.) The first Zeekr vehicle featuring Intel’s AI hardware will roll out later this year. \n\n“We are bringing the AI PC to the car,” Weast said in a briefing with reporters last week. He followed that up with a bit of a reality check, saying, “However, we can’t just put a PC in a car. We know that automakers need to be able to re-architect their vehicle, as I mentioned, to be software defined.” \n\n\"The first company to sign up to install these chips in its vehicles is Zeekr\"\n\nThe company aims to introduce a “family” of systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) for these future software-defined vehicles (SDVs), with the first rolling out at the end of 2024. Intel wouldn’t name any other auto customers beyond Zeekr but said it was in active talks with a number of OEMs (original equipment manufacturers — sorry for all the acronyms). \n\nThe auto industry is facing a number of unique challenges as it tries to cram ever-more sophisticated computers into its cars in anticipation of the mass adoption of electric vehicles and the evolution of more advanced software. It’s a cliche to say that cars are becoming like smartphones on wheels, able to update their software through over-the-air updates and increasingly reliant on intricate superconductors to complete basic functions. But it’s also true. \n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pVQk5WyDmlUU8nWLWvyPtkcb__M=/0x0:7360x4912/7360x4912/filters:focal(3680x2456:3681x2457)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214173/1800087137.jpg]\n\nBut Weast said that the effort to build a vehicle defined by software has a ways to go still — mainly because Intel has yet to put its stamp on it. “Nobody’s really been doing software defined quite right yet,” he said. “We have a unique perspective and a unique set of capabilities that we think can help the industry transition their vehicles to be truly software defined.”\n\nIntel says its SoCs are in 50 million cars on the road, powering infotainment displays and instrument clusters. Starting with Zeekr, the company will make its case to individual car companies that its AI-enhanced chips can help usher in a new era of software-defined vehicles. \n\n\"“Nobody’s really been doing software defined quite right yet.”\"\n\nVehicles that have Intel’s AI chips will have better voice assistants, improved video conferencing capabilities, and video gaming options for rear-seat passengers, the company  promises. Rather than fumble with multiple menus and submenus to turn certain features on, you could just tell your car to do it, Weast said. Improved safety features, like driver monitoring systems for hands-free driving, are another possibility. A car with Intel’s AI system could even “proactively enable” safety features that the driver has already turned off, Weast said. \n\n“I think there’s a lot of opportunities for AI to enhance the vehicle experience and make tech a little less obtrusive,” he added, “and have it be more predictive and fit more seamlessly into the driving or passenger experience.”\n\nEnergy management and EV battery size are also playing a prominent role in Intel’s CES announcements today. The company is acquiring Silicon Mobility SAS, “a fabless automotive silicon and software company that designs, develops and deploys EV energy management SoCs.” The aim is to help EVs transition from first-generation batteries — heavy, expensive, mineral-rich — to something more lightweight and easier to manage. \n\nWeast envisions EV batteries that are lighter in weight and that use fewer minerals but still deliver the same range — or better — as the current generation. Intel is working with SAE International to chair a new committee to develop a new standard for EV power management, the company said. \n\n“Batteries are now the heaviest and most expensive elements of the vehicle,” Weast said. “Vehicles today frankly remind us of first generation laptops.”\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Would you carry a foldable OLED monitor?","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T22:10:12.995Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T22:10:12.995Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031991/would-you-carry-a-foldable-oled-monitor","author":[],"articleBody":"I would totally use the new Asus ZenScreen Fold that’s on display here at CES 2024 — if the price were right.

The company announced a new feature of its InHome replenishment service that aims to automatically order the right stuff at the right time, and hand it off to a delivery person who can drop things off in a fridge in your house. Shoppers with the $20 monthly InHome membership already get the seamless drop-off, but they still have to select items themselves. By training its models on both your habits and Walmart’s overall knowledge of how people buy and consume stuff, the company figures it can begin to make your grocery list for you.\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L2wFEToTtsSYr6hQsAat9y9S--A=/0x0:2500x1673/2500x1673/filters:focal(1250x837:1251x838)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25215115/Walmart_AI_search.png]\n\nFor now, it’s just an idea in development. Amazon tried something similar with the Dash Replenishment Service, but that’s now mostly meant for things like smoke detectors and laundry machines. Keeping tabs on something as varied as food consumption is much harder. Both companies have had recurring deliveries for years, obviously, but Walmart’s plan is to be much more responsive to your actual needs rather than shipping you new cereal every two weeks no matter what.\n\nWalmart is making a big push into AI-powered shopping and has set up a huge booth at CES 2024 to show off its latest and greatest. It’s launching a generative AI search engine for Walmart’s iOS app, which allows for much broader queries; instead of typing in the name of a TV or a specific ingredient, you can say “What do I need for a Super Bowl party?” and the bot will suggest some things to get. \n\nSam’s Club, Walmart’s Costco-like warehouse store, is also building a device that sits at the exit of the store and scans shoppers’ carts to make sure they’ve paid for everything in there. (The goal is to obviate the people standing at the doors manually checking everyone’s receipt and cart, and the long lines that process tends to create.) This, too, will sound familiar to anyone following Amazon — the company’s Go stores also use computer vision to track what’s in your cart. It’s rolling out to Sam’s Club stores now, and don’t be surprised to see something similar in a Walmart before long.\n\nIn general, Walmart’s goal is to use AI to make the shopping process easier and quicker. It’s investing in drone delivery to get stuff to you more quickly, and in all these AI tools to help you comb through the internet’s infinite shopping aisles. Sometimes that means making shopping fun; sometimes it means getting it over with faster. Sometimes it means you don’t do any shopping at all, and the milk just never runs out.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Walmart is bringing drone deliveries to 1.8 million more Texas households","alternativeHeadline":"The retail giant is partnering with Wing and Zipline to cover 75 percent of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area by the end of 2024.","datePublished":"2024-01-09T22:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T22:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031714/walmart-drone-delivery-wing-zipline-dallas-fort-worth-texas","author":[],"articleBody":"Walmart is expanding its drone delivery program to 1.8 million more households in Texas.

Walmart says deliveries arrive in 30 minutes or less, with some reaching customers’ doorsteps in as fast as 10 minutes.\n\nIn 2023, Walmart partnered with Wing, which is owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, to deliver to 60,000 more homes in the Dallas-Fort Worth area from two different stores. But this marks its biggest expansion yet, adding 30 more towns and municipalities within the Texas metroplex. The program also now uses drones from both Wing and Zipline to make deliveries in the area, both of which are approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones “without a dedicated observer being able to see the drone at all times.”\n\n[Image: These are all the areas Walmart’s drone delivery service will soon cover. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2kDSpXUbZMdfm2pSDSOEXYmTc6U=/0x0:1000x560/1000x560/filters:focal(500x280:501x281)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214644/Walmart_drone_expansion_visualization.jpg]\n\n“Zipline is excited to enable Walmart’s vision of providing customer delivery so fast it feels like teleportation,” Zipline co-founder and CEO Keller Rinaudo Cliffton said in a statement. “We’re excited for folks across Dallas-Fort Worth to experience delivery that is 7x as fast, zero emissions and whisper quiet.”\n\nSo far, Walmart has completed over 20,000 successful drone deliveries. Wing says it will start delivering to new locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area “in the coming months” and expects to complete the expansion with Walmart within the year.

At first, the Roxi channel just appears to play music videos, but when you hit the pause button on your remote, the TV pauses — despite being a broadcast channel. There’s no DVR involved or app you need to download.  And with the press of your remote, you can skip ahead to the next music video or even choose from other playlists, all within the broadcast channel. It’s something that’s been central to the promise of ATSC 3.0, and Roxi thinks it’s finally delivering.\n\nRoxi CEO Rob Lewis knows a bit about music streaming. In the 2000s, he was the CEO of Omnifone, one of the first music streaming companies — back when Nokia was still the phone du jour. He founded Roxi in 2014 to find a way to make music streaming easier, and he quickly collected a roster of famous investors, including Sheryl Crow, Robbie Williams, and Stephen Fry.\n\nNow, he’s focused on improving ATSC 3.0 because, in practice, it kind of sucks. If your market has channels that support it, and if you have an ATSC 3.0 tuner, your TV will get better-quality video and audio. It’s a noticeable improvement but not exactly the kind of thing that would make either broadcasters or audiences race out to buy a new TV. Its lackluster rollout and support have hurt the standard — with LG last year announcing it would not be including ATSC 3.0 tuners in its 2024 TVs.\n\nBut ATSC 3.0 has real potential as an alternative to paid streaming apps and internet-dependent FAST TV channels — particularly when it comes to interactive TV. Lewis thinks Roxi has finally figured that part of ATSC 3.0 out. Roxi accomplishes the feat using technology Lewis calls “FastStream,” which temporarily downloads an app to the TV’s short-term memory. The app is on the TV only as long as you’re on the channel, and when you flip to another channel, it goes away. (Lewis calls it a “transitory app.”)\n\nWhile limited to music for now, the tech could eventually be used to actually buy stuff directly from your TV, get weather on demand, skip around the news to get the local segments you actually want to watch, or possibly even give you on-demand TV and films —  all things that ATSC 3.0 has been promising for years and failing to deliver. \n\nThat’s probably why Sinclair partnered with Roxi. Sinclair currently owns about 40 percent of the broadcast TV market in the United States, and given the state of broadcast TV, it’s on borrowed time. Sinclair and other broadcasters need to compete with streaming and social media — which are both far more nimble and interactive. Roxi’s FastStream technology could help with that. At one point in our conversation, Lewis compared the Roxi channel to TikTok in that it’s all preprogrammed and you can skip ahead if you don’t like what it shows you.\n\nThe channel will be available in Las Vegas through Friday, as it’s currently being used to demonstrate the technology at CES. Then, it’s expected to appear in all US markets that currently have ATSC 3.0 channels by the end of Q1 2024 — both those dominated by Sinclair and those not.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"What if your Samsung flip phone could flip further?","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T20:11:16.377Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T20:11:16.377Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031959/what-if-your-samsung-flip-phone-could-flip-further","author":[],"articleBody":"Imagine no more: one of Samsung Display’s two new folding flip phone concepts at CES 2024 does that: the Samsung Display Flex In\u0026Out. \n\nThe other is the Flex Liple, which I hear stands for “light” and “simple.” Since they both ditch the cover screen, perhaps it’s a way to manufacture less expensive flip phones, too.\n\n[Attachment: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8VQJtgV/]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Netflix’s new 3 Body Problem trailer is all about the mystery","alternativeHeadline":"The sci-fi adaptation from David Benioff, D.B.

Whereas the previous trailer focused on the incredibly immersive virtual reality game at the core of the story, the latest clip focuses on something different: the mystery. Basically, a whole bunch of scientists have gone missing, and Benedict Wong’s character is trying to figure out what it all means.\n\nThe show, of course, is based on the novel by Liu Cixin (which was just the first part of a trilogy), and Netflix describes the premise thusly:\n\n\u003e The story begins in 1960s China when a young woman makes a fateful decision that reverberates across space and time into the present day. When the laws of nature as we know them inexplicably unravel, a tight-knit group of brilliant scientists must join forces with an unflinching detective to stop humanity’s greatest threat.\n\nIt features an excellent cast — in addition to Wong, there’s Jovan Adepo, John Bradley, Rosalind Chao, Liam Cunningham, Eiza González, Jess Hong, Marlo Kelly, Alex Sharp, Sea Shimooka, Zine Tseng, Saamer Usmani, and Jonathan Pryce — and is being helmed by showrunners Alexander Woo, David Benioff, and D.B. Weiss (the former duo being best known for another epic adaptation with Game of Thrones on HBO). In a post on Netflix’s Tudum site, Woo talked a bit about how the team is approaching shifting 3 Body Problem from book to television.\n\n“What we are hoping to do is to convey the experience — if not necessarily the exact details — of the novel onto the screen,” he explained. “What stayed, we hope, is the sense of wonderment and the sense of scope, of scale, where the problems are no longer just the problems of an individual or even a nation, but of an entire species.”\n\nThe new trailer reveal was actually part of CES 2024 — which makes a certain kind of sense given 3 Body Problem’s sleek, futuristic VR headset. The show starts streaming on March 21st.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Luminar says its laser sensors can do automatic emergency steering","alternativeHeadline":"The Florida-based company is also taking its partnership with Mercedes-Benz to the racetrack.","datePublished":"2024-01-09T20:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T20:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031529/luminar-lidar-mercedes-amg-f1-safety-car-automatic-steering","author":[],"articleBody":"All vehicles are required to have automatic emergency braking, but the technology is not the best at preventing crashes, especially at highway speeds. But what about automatic emergency steering? \n\nFlorida-based lidar company Luminar unveiled a new automatic emergency steering (AES) feature powered by its Iris Plus sensor. The idea is to use the laser sensor, in combination with the vehicle’s other safety systems, to proactively avoid crashes without driver intervention. \n\nThe company demonstrated the new feature at CES in Las Vegas this week. The hope is that Luminar’s long-range lidar, with up to 300 meters (984 feet) of range in the right conditions, can detect obstacles and initiate driving maneuvers before the driver does. \n\n\"The company demonstrated the new feature at CES in Las Vegas this week\"\n\nDoing so safely, both for the driver and others on the road, will be key to whether Luminar’s AES system gains traction. Third-party testing by groups like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Consumer Reports, and AAA will also determine whether the company’s claims can be verified. \n\nOf course, most drivers aren’t ready for situations in which their car makes decisions for them. Often, you hear car owners complain about being bombarded with too many alerts and notifications. You can imagine how they would react if their car suddenly swerved to avoid, say, a plastic cup in the road. Luminar will need to make sure that its system isn’t triggered by false positives. \n\nIn other news, the company announced that it has extended its partnership with Mercedes-Benz to integrate its Iris Plus lidar in the official FIA F1 safety car. Luminar is teaming up with the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 team on the project and also plans to integrate its sensor into the team’s Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series. \n\n“The ability to detect still and moving objects at high speeds and under wide ranging conditions make Luminar’s LiDAR an excellent match for the Official FIA F1 Safety Car,” the company says in a statement. \n\nLuminar has emerged as one of the more ambitious players in the lidar industry. As internal turmoil and financial uncertainty grip its rivals, Luminar has secured commitments from a number of companies to purchase its lidars. In addition to Mercedes-Benz, the company has deals with Volvo, Audi, Toyota Research Institute, Intel’s Mobileye, Airbus, and two Chinese companies: automaker SAIC and AV operator Pony.ai.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"The Rabbit R1 is a surprisingly nice little handheld gadget.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T19:46:56.490Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T19:46:56.490Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031928/the-rabbit-r1-is-a-surprisingly-nice-little-handheld-gadget","author":[],"articleBody":"Rabbit’s not shipping its new AI-powered R1 device until March, but the company just launched it officially today at CES.

Mercedes-AMG aims to change that with a new “interactive musical experience” that it’s created along with musician and entrepreneur Will.i.am. \n\nAt CES this year, the automaker announced MBUX Sound Drive, a new feature that uses sensors and software to link music to driving. It’s hard to describe, but Mercedes says it’s composed musical tracks to pair with regular functions like recuperation, acceleration, steering, and braking, turning the whole car — as Will.i.am puts it — into its own “orchestra.” \n\n\"A new feature that uses sensors and software to link the music to the driving\"\n\nDrivers would opt in by selecting Sound Drive through their infotainment screen, which then connects the car’s hardware with the music software through “precise ‘in-car signals’ that enable the music to react to the driving characteristics in real-time.” \n\nMercedes envisions this working in several different ways. For example, soothing music would start playing when the windshield wipers are turned on — in essence, matching inclement weather with lo-fi beats for driving. Meanwhile, an EDM beat would get progressively faster as you accelerate down the highway. \n\nIt’s an interesting idea, mainly because sound and music have always played a central role in driving. Whether it’s Carpool Karaoke or Ansel Elgort’s getaway driver character rocking out to the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in Baby Driver, the inclusion of familiar lyrics or a heart-thumping beat can turn any errand or road trip into a memorable experience. \n\nOf course, in the era of electric vehicles, music and other diegetic sounds become more heightened thanks to the absence of an internal combustion engine. But while some try to fill the void with fake exhaust through external speakers, others are aiming for something more pleasant. The Fiat 500e, for example, uses classical music as its automatic low-speed sound, which is legally required to alert pedestrians and others who are visually impaired. \n\n\"It’s an interesting idea, mainly because sound and music have always played a central role in driving\"\n\nBut if Bach or Will.i.am aren’t your most played artists, have no fear: Mercedes says it wants Sound Drive to be an “open music platform” so any musician can create their own auditory soundscape for driving. Using the company’s MBUX operating system, artists from around the world are invited to “create tracks” for a variety of driving functions. Imagine telling someone you’re an aspiring Sound Drive musician or that you composed the windshield wiper beat.\n\nThis project certainly seems more well suited to Will.i.am’s skill set given his spotty track record with tech startups. His smart home startup, Wink, has struggled to stay afloat, he’s been a ubiquitous, if baffling, presence at CES in years past, and his smartwatch... well, the less said, the better. \n\nSound Drive will be available to owners of Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Benz vehicles equipped with the second generation of the MBUX system starting in mid-2024. The feature can be downloaded via an over-the-air software update. Pricing information was not immediately available.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Mercedes-Benz’s best-in-class voice assistant is getting an AI boost","alternativeHeadline":"The automaker’s MBUX voice assistant purports to use large language models to enable more ‘human-like’ interactions.","datePublished":"2024-01-09T19:30:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T19:30:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24028012/mercedes-benz-mbux-voice-assistant-ai-llm-mbos-ces","author":[],"articleBody":"Mercedes-Benz is supercharging its in-car voice assistant with generative AI, paving the way for more natural interactions and personalized driver experiences. \n\nThe automaker’s upgraded MBUX Virtual Assistant will run on the next-generation MB.OS operating system to create “the most human-like interface with a Mercedes-Benz yet,” the company says. Examples include predictive behavior, like playing the morning’s news headlines upon entering the vehicle or offering to dial into a meeting if the vehicle owner’s calendar indicates they are running late for a meeting. \n\nMercedes vehicles already have voice-command capabilities, allowing drivers to use the phrase, “Hey, Mercedes,” followed by a short command to do things like adjust the temperature in the vehicle, find a navigation destination, or place a phone call. \n\n\"“The most human-like interface with a Mercedes-Benz yet”\"\n\nGenerative AI could make these queries more natural and less prone to false positives — theoretically. ChatGPT and other large-language model (LLM) chatbots have been known to serve up false information and OpenAI is being targeted in a number of defamation and copyright infringement lawsuits. Mercedes won’t say which company it is working with to update its voice assistant. \n\nMercedes and other automakers are trying to get out in front of the AI boom that’s exploding across the tech industry. Companies like Volkswagen, BMW, and Hyundai are promising more sophisticated in-car voice assistants bolstered with the same LLMs that power the most popular chatbots. \n\nThe German automaker has what many consider to be one of the most capable voice assistants in MBUX, which was first introduced in 2018 and is short for “Mercedes-Benz User Experience.”\n\nThe voice assistant’s speech will rely on an LLM for natural dialogue and answers to customer questions. It will also feature four “personality traits”: natural, predictive, personal, and empathetic. “The effect is more like a conversation with a friend,” the company claims. “The assistant answers questions based on general knowledge and can also ask intelligent questions to clarify intent and draw conclusions.”\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4L9ZqmRBcFH-b5W3mbAPRFKrtg=/0x0:4000x2550/4000x2550/filters:focal(2000x1275:2001x1276)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25209163/24C0021_005.jpg]\n\nThe assistant can be customized to fit the driver’s preferences, including tone and speaking style. Want something more empathetic for those days when traffic is making you late? The MBUX assistant will be there for you. \n\nAmong its many suppliers, Mercedes relies on Nvidia for its water-cooled chips to power its MB.OS system. The San Jose-based company has been developing high-powered GPUs and auto-grade systems-on-a-chip for a number of car clients, enabling features such as advanced driver assist, in-car graphics, and AI. \n\nMercedes-Benz spokesperson Cathleen Decker declined to name the specific company that was supplying its generative AI technology. “The company works with a range of technology partners to develop and implement the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and natural language processing,” she said in an email. “Mercedes-Benz is committed to working with the best partners in the industry to ensure that the MBUX system remains at the forefront of automotive technology.”\n\nPreviously, Mercedes said it was testing OpenAI’s ChatGPT for its cars, but today’s press release makes no mention of the buzzy chatbot. The company said it was interested in evaluating ChatGPT’s ability to help drivers get answers to complex questions while keeping their hands on the wheels and eyes on the road. Volkswagen announced yesterday its plan to install ChatGPT in its cars starting later this year. \n\n\"In-car distractions are at an all-time high\"\n\nIn-car distractions are at an all time high. But rather than try to limit the amount of technology being crammed into cars, automakers are increasingly turning to more high-tech fixes to encourage drivers to stay focused on the road. \n\nMercedes says the first cars with MB.OS are coming with the automaker’s upcoming Mercedes Modular Architecture, or MMA, which is slated for 2025. The company’s Concept CLA, which had its North American debut at CES in Las Vegas this week, offers a sneak peak at what these vehicles will look like when close to production. \n\nIn addition, Mercedes is adding more videoconferencing and streaming options to its cars, including Microsoft Teams and Sony Pictures Ridevu. And a new feature called Surround Navigation offers better situational awareness presented as 3D graphics on the infotainment display powered by Unity’s game engine.\n\n\u003e For instance, it shows the type of traffic, be it another car, van, truck or even a cyclist. It shows pedestrians close to the roadside as well as potential hazards. And it superimposes route guidance into a realistic representation of the surroundings – particularly helpful in busy urban environments.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Sony brought its new PS5 colors to CES","alternativeHeadline":"The PS5 slim really pops in red and blue.

Samsung says more details are to come later this year. \n\n[Attachment: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RRYvksqEvweKUN20asf1b0vJfkY=/0x0:6438x4261/6438x4261/filters:focal(3219x2131:3220x2132)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214660/2D_3D_Gaming_Monitor_001.jpg]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Formlabs says 3D-printed dentures made with its new resin look like the real thing.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T19:05:19.499Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T19:05:19.499Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031738/formlabs-says-3d-printed-dentures-made-with-its-new-resin-look-like-the-real-thing","author":[],"articleBody":"The company announced at CES today that its “Premium Teeth Resin” has been registered with the FDA and enables 3D-printed dentures with “life-like aesthetics” that mimic “natural teeth translucency and opalescence.” \n\nDentists can order the resin now for $550 per kilogram. \n\n[Attachment: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wBgu6hxBGpkw15oBiXGhXx4B2IM=/0x0:8688x5792/8688x5792/filters:focal(4344x2896:4345x2897)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214695/Formlabs_Premium_Teeth_Resin_011.jpg]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Hyundai says its four-passenger eVTOL will be ready for 2028","alternativeHeadline":"If this sounds familiar, that’s because the company introduced a prototype at CES back in 2020, too.","datePublished":"2024-01-09T19:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T19:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24028009/hyundai-air-mobility-supernal-evtol-ces","author":[],"articleBody":"The last time Hyundai brought an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) prototype to CES, it was 2020, and the South Korean automaker was talking bullishly about adding it to Uber’s forthcoming air taxi network. \n\nToday, Uber’s air taxi network has been sold to another startup, the air taxi industry as a whole is still struggling to get a commercial service up and running, and Hyundai is unveiling a new “product concept” that it says will be ready for production by 2028. \n\nSupernal, the automaker’s eVTOL division, says its S-A2 concept can cruise at 120mph and reach an altitude of 1,500 feet. It packs enough battery capacity for the type of 25- to 40-mile trips that helicopters commonly conduct between downtowns and airports for wealthy business types.\n\n\"Supernal says its S-A2 concept can cruise at 120mph and reach an altitude of 1,500 feet\"\n\nThe company says its aircraft will “operate as quietly as a dishwasher,” emitting 65 decibels in vertical takeoff and landing phases and 45dB while cruising horizontally. By comparison, the average helicopter puts out between 96 and 107db. Next to eliminating pollution, noise reduction is the most common argument in favor of electric aircraft. \n\nWith eight tilt rotors and an egg-shaped cabin, Supernal’s concept looks similar to other air taxi prototypes we’ve seen, including those from Joby Aviation, Wisk Aero, and Archer Aviation. \n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QywA8o0mAjb6G4eUkOX8CLD1iiA=/0x0:3840x2560/3840x2560/filters:focal(1920x1280:1921x1281)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25211643/Super_Ext_AY_28.png]\n\nSupernal is one of a handful of companies that wants to replace noisy, polluting helicopters and regional aircraft with all-electric, multi-rotor vehicles designed for short hops between nearby airports or quick trips from an urban downtown to a local airport.\n\nInitially, these aircraft were mislabeled as “flying cars” based on their ability to take off and land vertically like a helicopter and then shift to forward flight through the use of electric-powered tilt rotors. Early on, companies embraced the “flying car” label, seeking to capitalize on the retro-futuristic appeal that harkens back to old Popular Science and Popular Mechanics covers and engineering eccentricities like the “Moller Skycar.”\n\nBut as they slowly plod through endless testing procedures mandated by a lengthy regulatory process, they have since rallied around new nomenclature, like eVTOL, urban air mobility, advanced air mobility, and air taxis.\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-ckVtAflPYp7i3NFwUm7CoT2vI=/0x0:3840x2560/3840x2560/filters:focal(1920x1280:1921x1281)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25211647/Supernal_Ext_AY_03.jpg]\n\nThere’s been plenty of turbulence in this emerging industry. A number of startups have gone out of business, most notably, Google founder Larry Page’s Kitty Hawk, which helped kick off the boom in 2017. There have been lawsuits, layoffs, mergers, and no shortage of drama, including a handful of fires and at least one (uncrewed) crash.\n\nSupernal’s ties to Hyundai could give it an advantage in the manufacturing of its aircraft, as the spinoff will be able to rely on the automaker’s mass production capabilities to help it get started. But the company won’t have any special advantages when it comes to regulatory approval, which promises to be long and difficult. \n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yqkCcZUIi-BSJTk8uBB35wvk1nM=/0x0:6000x3710/6000x3710/filters:focal(3000x1855:3001x1856)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213919/Supernal_CES_2024_Press_05.jpg]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yV8bymWFevJnaG_K6DFqB4YxkkQ=/0x0:6000x3195/6000x3195/filters:focal(3000x1598:3001x1599)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213920/Supernal_CES_2024_Press_03.jpg]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wNtKAvPxbE1LoAcc6Qder7OEjsQ=/0x0:6000x3737/6000x3737/filters:focal(3000x1869:3001x1870)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213921/Supernal_CES_2024_Press_02.jpg]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcwNDNEs-_yrgbeeowJdOGckvis=/0x0:6000x4002/6000x4002/filters:focal(3000x2001:3001x2002)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213922/Supernal_CES_2024_Press_01.jpg]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CA6Puan6X0f_AaxlZ9omzAvEXsE=/0x0:3840x2560/3840x2560/filters:focal(1920x1280:1921x1281)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213926/Supernal_Ext_AY_20.jpg]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0lWg9QtVlyTD3YKDq6lc3cBbR2M=/0x0:3840x2560/3840x2560/filters:focal(1920x1280:1921x1281)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213927/Supernal_Ext_AY_24.jpg]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gsaKQKz71RyMvuqP4ATtOIQQ4Jc=/0x0:3840x2560/3840x2560/filters:focal(1920x1280:1921x1281)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213928/Supernal_Ext_AY_26A.jpg]\n\nUnder FAA rules, aviation companies need to receive three types of certification before launching a commercial service in the US: type certification means the aircraft meets all of the FAA’s design and safety standards; production certification is the approval to begin manufacturing the aircraft; and air carrier certification means the company can officially conduct commercial air taxi services.\n\nSupernal says it’s putting a lot of focus on batteries, particularly, the ability to upgrade to lighter cells when the technology improves. One of the main challenges with electric flight is the power-to-weight ratio. Heavy batteries create more weight, requiring more power to compensate, and even bigger batteries. That’s why Supernal and others are focused on short flights and regional hops. \n\n\"Supernal says it’s putting a lot of focus on batteries\"\n\nBut Supernal isn’t so daunted by the technological challenges that it can’t picture a cozy interior with fine leather upholstery. The design is clean and minimal, with lighting meant to give the impression of being in a larger space. \n\nHyundai isn’t the only global company to see visions of small electric aircraft buzzing over cities. Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler, and Dodge, is committed to mass-producing air taxis for Archer Aviation. United and Delta airlines are also invested in the technology, as are Boeing and NASA. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Honda debuts new global EV series, Honda Zero, coming in 2026","alternativeHeadline":"Honda Zero includes two concepts: the sleek, sedan-like Saloon, and a boxier big-booty van-thing called the Space-Hub.","datePublished":"2024-01-09T19:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T19:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24030236/honda-zero-ev-global-series-concept-ces","author":[],"articleBody":"Honda announced a new global electric vehicle series, dubbed Honda Zero, presenting it as an antidote to the recent trend of “thick, heavy” EVs seen on the road today. Honda says it will introduce its first model, based on a sleek, sedan-like concept called the Saloon, starting in North America in 2026. \n\nIn addition to the Saloon, Honda also introduced a boxier van-esque concept called the Space-Hub. The concepts are meant to demonstrate Honda’s lighter approach to EV development, riding atop a “thin” vehicle architecture with a low floor that’s meant to accentuate aerodynamics. \n\n[Image: Yep, still an H. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6zqhFGIe-0PA1zHjawZ5KMk07rA=/0x0:1200x570/1200x570/filters:focal(600x285:601x286)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212379/c_HNew_H_Mark__1_.jpg]\n\n“Thin” and “light” are two of the three principles, the third being “wise,” that Honda says is guiding the development of the Honda Zero EV series. The automaker stressed a start-from-scratch engineering approach to the lineup, including a new H-mark logo that it says will be featured exclusively on its next-generation EVs.\n\nHow exactly Honda plans to achieve this new weightlessness in its next-gen EVs is still unknown. Many of the EVs hitting the US market this year are big, heavy SUVs and trucks, complementing a broader trend in car buying that has seen some companies stop making sedans altogether. But Honda seems to be suggesting there’s another way, especially around smaller, slimmer, and more lightweight vehicles. \n\nHonda, of course, is also partnered with Sony on the design and development of the latter’s Afeela electric car, which was first introduced at CES last year. The Afeela is also coming to the North American market by 2026, though there’s no word on how it connects — if at all — to the Honda Zero lineup.\n\n[Image: The low, sloping shape gives it a sporty feel that cribs from Honda’s Formula 1 experience. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5EDXCb_yz0xxb5lWV4pgGzdcSes=/0x0:5340x2784/5340x2784/filters:focal(2670x1392:2671x1393)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212374/c__SALOON.jpg]\n\nThe Saloon has a sloping fastback shape with unique rectangular lights in the front and rear that resemble a vintage Black \u0026 Decker Dustbuster. The vehicle seems like it rides extremely low to the ground for an overall sporty performance derived from Formula 1 racing. The interior is minimal, with Tron-like lighting accents, a single central display, and wheels with pixelated covers that peer through the darkness. \n\nThe Space-Hub resembles a minivan with minimal overhangs and a rear light that has a similar look to Rivian’s electric delivery vans for Amazon. The Space-Hub will also include a huge panoramic moonroof that curves over on the side to create an almost greenhouse-like effect. Inside are two bench seats facing each other, suggesting that an autonomous shuttle service could be a possible future use case. There is no rear window, meaning drivers will likely need to rely on cameras to see out the back. \n\n[Image: The Space-Hub is neither a hub nor eligible to go to space. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zKemm9jLEbZ6oIjmQaid5LXzpXM=/0x0:6000x3074/6000x3074/filters:focal(3000x1537:3001x1538)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212375/c_DSPACE_HUB.jpg]\n\nNo real specs are being released, but Honda says these future EVs will be both partially and fully autonomous, depending on the configuration. A marketing video featured a retractable steering wheel that emerges from the dash when needed, suggesting that customers will be able to toggle between human and robot driving as the mood fits. \n\nThe advanced driver-assist features will be based on Honda’s Sensing platform, which debuted with the Honda Legend in Japan in 2021. Honda Sensing is a Level 2 system, meaning drivers still need to pay attention to the road and are legally liable for the car’s operation. Hands-free driving on “expressways and surface streets” will be available starting in the mid-2020s, including in more affordable models, the company says. \n\n[Image: It’s coming to suck up your dust! https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-HtNdJokXKIfJ0XUhd260R3LQI=/0x0:6000x3074/6000x3074/filters:focal(3000x1537:3001x1538)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212376/c_BSALOON.jpg]\n\nThe Honda Zero series will be sporty, borrowing performance-enabling designs from the automaker’s Formula 1 racing experience. Honda is also aiming for optimum battery efficiency through its use of e-Axles, a system consisting of a motor, inverter, and gearbox that converts electric power into energy for driving.\n\nLike several other automakers, Honda is planning on introducing more AI-powered features in its future lineup of vehicles. These features will collect data about driver preferences to present a more personalized experience as well as make route suggestions based on location information.  \n\n[Image: The Space-Hub’s interior is very greenhouse-ish. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dmpFPc0h-Dn6JMpOkZBXWF-B_mg=/0x0:3840x2560/3840x2560/filters:focal(1920x1280:1921x1281)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212382/c_ESPACE_HUB.jpg]\n\n[Image: A retractable steering wheel allows drivers to toggle between manual and automated driving. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2hfc6vDZnSeaymqcNDkL5FUowoA=/0x0:8239x4508/8239x4508/filters:focal(4120x2254:4121x2255)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212381/c_CSALOON.jpg]\n\nSo far, Honda’s global EV offerings have been sparse. There’s the Honda e city car, only available in Europe and Asia and set to be discontinued this year, and the Prologue SUV, which is coming soon to North America. There’s also the upcoming Acura ZDX from the company’s performance brand. Overall, Honda is aiming for 30 new EVs by 2030 with 2 million units sold, 100 percent zero-emission auto sales by 2040, and carbon neutrality “for all products and corporate activities” by 2050.\n\nBut there have also been setbacks. Honda recently canceled its plans to build a lineup of affordable EVs with General Motors. And Cruise, GM’s autonomous unit in which Honda is also an investor, has paused all public operations after a pedestrian was injured by one of the company’s driverless vehicles.\n\nThe Prologue SUV is set to reach customers this year, Honda’s first major effort to sell electric vehicles in North America since the oft-maligned Clarity. But while that car would look right at home nestled in with the CRV and Pilot, these new vehicles are designed for double takes.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Walking, easier, with the WiRobotics WIM.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T18:50:14.258Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T18:50:14.258Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031811/walking-easier-with-the-wirobotics-wim","author":[],"articleBody":"I’m not even a little embarrassed a robot helped me walk around CES 2024.

This year, the company is taking on the classic hairdryer with the AirLight Pro, and it’s doing so in an unconventional way.\n\nMost conventional hairdryers rely on thermal coils to produce heat and air that then dries the hair. Unless you use heat protectant, it can be pretty brutal on your hair with frequent use. Meanwhile, Dyson’s Supersonic hairdryer mostly uses a powerful motor and clever ergonomic design to maximize airflow while also reducing heat. L’Oréal’s AirLight Pro also does that, but it adds infrared light into the mix.\n\n[Image: The AirLight Pro has a circle of infrared lights surrounding a motor that directs airflow. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fb4xYzkIZZAIYAVnP0e-B54-QQ8=/0x0:7680x4320/7680x4320/filters:focal(3840x2160:3841x2161)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25209702/AirlightPro4_16x9__1_.png]\n\n“It’s inspired by the way the environment dries rain. So when it rains, the day after you have wind, you have sun, and it’s a combination of the wind and sun that are the most effective to dry the rain,” says Guive Balooch, global vice president of L’Oréal’s Technology Incubator. In the same way, Balooch says that a mix of infrared light and powerful airflow help mimic the sun and wind but for your hair. That, in turn, reduces the need for heat.\n\nAccording to Balooch, the hairdryer has a circle of infrared lights and, within that, there’s a smaller circle that pushes out the air. The light helps water droplets dry on the surface of the hair, while leaving moisture intact within the strand. Balooch says that different wavelengths of infrared light can have opposite effects on hair. For example, the red / yellow end of the spectrum is closer to UV light — which isn’t so great for your hair. Blue and purple light, however, has a more hydrating effect. The result is supposedly a 30 percent faster drying time and a 31 percent reduction in energy usage, with more hydrated and smoother-looking hair in the process. Of course, we’ll have to test it out to see how those claims translate in real life, but I’m curious to get my hands on the AirLight Pro on the show floor later this week. \n\n[Image: The AirLight Pro can automatically detect attachments, like the diffuser pictured here. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KaM_uqOAt79ROYq9cCEuCQOTjYI=/0x0:7680x7680/7680x7680/filters:focal(3840x3840:3841x3841)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25209708/AirlightPro5_1x1.jpg]\n\nTo make the hairdryer, L’Oréal partnered with Zuvi, a startup founded by former DJI engineers that made a similar light-based hairdryer. The AirLight Pro is the result of L’Oréal’s team collaborating with Zuvi to take it to the next level. That includes developing an app, where users can customize heat preferences, and a set of smart attachments, including a diffuser and a concentrator nozzle. When you snap on an attachment, the hairdryer will automatically recognize it and adjust the speed and temperature.\n\nThe AirLight Pro is targeted for both professional and consumer use — though it’ll first be available at salons under the L’Oréal Professionnel brand. It’s expected to reach consumers later in the year, and Balooch says the company is targeting a sub-$400 price. \n\nBalooch also offered up a few updates on other products L’Oréal’s shown off at CES over the years. The Colorsonic, an at-home hair dying gadget from CES 2022, is currently in production with a launch slated for mid-2024. Meanwhile, last year’s Brow Magic makeup applicator will first launch in Asia at the end of 2024 under the Shu Uemura brand. Seeing CES concept gadgets actually make their way to consumers isn’t a given, so it’s neat to see L’Oréal actively working to make its ideas a reality. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Beauty tech is here at CES.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T18:36:52.409Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T18:36:52.409Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031710/beauty-tech-is-here-at-ces","author":[],"articleBody":"While CES is known for wacky displays, laptop concepts, and TVs galore, the show’s opening keynote this year is from L’Oréal.

At least not right away. His company’s new gadget, a $199 standalone AI device called the R1, is so staggeringly ambitious that Lyu seems to think he can’t help but replace your phone at some point. Just not quite yet. \n\n(Update January 10th, 4:45PM ET: Rabbit announced its initial 10,00 unit run of R1 units has already sold out, and now it’s taking pre-orders for a second shipment in the spring.)\n\nThe R1 looks a little like a Playdate console or maybe a modernized version of one of those ’90s-era handheld TVs. It’s a standalone gadget about half the size of an iPhone with a 2.88-inch touchscreen, a rotating camera for taking photos and videos, and a scroll wheel / button you press to navigate around or talk to the device’s built-in assistant. It has a 2.3GHz MediaTek processor, 4GB of memory, and 128GB of storage, all inside a rounded body designed in collaboration with the design firm Teenage Engineering. All Rabbit says about the battery is that it lasts “all day.”\n\nI spent a few minutes with the R1 after Rabbit’s launch event, and it’s an impressive piece of hardware. Only one device (Lyu’s) was actually functional, and even that one couldn’t do much because of spotty hotel Wi-Fi. But the R1 is surprisingly light and feels much nicer than it looks in pictures. Its buttons are clicky and satisfying, which is no surprise from Teenage Engineering, and the whole thing fits nicely in my grip. It’s definitely a fingerprint magnet, though.\n\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hCAfaNFMxj36PNdjuVbhGw4s2xY=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214893/videoframe_858490.png]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DnSWtsVF7DVjL8Gk0zaI6h1Szm0=/0x0:4032x3024/4032x3024/filters:focal(2016x1512:2017x1513)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214919/IMG_6029.JPG]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cyIOXElLo7Z7uk7xcBefQeYqIas=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214892/videoframe_787161.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xYBmc2-qpvX8uSEpmcVU8j5Ty9I=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214886/videoframe_1411744.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/73329rB5MHE2Zk2j5_jA2x2X2Yg=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214888/videoframe_1391131.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QT6VqxlFSYYzasBHnhHtAzG-js4=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214889/videoframe_1046683.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eC5OLEkb2k8mvJ4_N7MqVo_22aI=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214890/videoframe_957848.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XqLEt9ga4Hx9npN2EnQ6NK86BFA=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214891/videoframe_811931.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bfrgKlNu8vlCTL66b-MmJy3v5lA=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214883/videoframe_701592.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nt3ebiAoA4GXECDoDs2ylNat6hw=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214884/videoframe_1509155.png]\n[Image: Rabbit R1 UI and features. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6-2GPnHCx9M5wDfhUC_ydM_gwvE=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214885/videoframe_1514599.png]\n\nThe software inside the R1 is the real story: Rabbit’s operating system, called Rabbit OS, and the AI tech underneath. Rather than a ChatGPT-like large language model, Rabbit says Rabbit OS is based on a “Large Action Model,” and the best way I can describe it is as a sort of universal controller for apps. “We wanted to find a universal solution just like large language models,” he says. “How can we find a universal solution to actually trigger our services, regardless of whether you’re a website or an app or whatever platform or desktop?”\n\n[Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22wlLy7hKP4]\n\nIn spirit, it’s an idea similar to Alexa or Google Assistant. Rabbit OS can control your music, order you a car, buy your groceries, send your messages, and more, all through a single interface. No balancing apps and logins — just ask for what you want and let the device deliver. The R1’s on-screen interface will be a series of category-based cards, for music or transportation or video chats, and Lyu says the screen mostly exists so that you can verify the model’s output on your own.\n\n[Image: With a rotating camera, a button, and a speaker, you can do a lot of Google Assistant-style stuff with the R1. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sw0vmZKSVCiZxm5w3WsJ7yHg60A=/0x0:2880x2880/2880x2880/filters:focal(1440x1440:1441x1441)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212783/rabbit_r1_back.jpg]\n\nRather than build a bunch of APIs and try to convince developers to support the R1, though, Rabbit trained its model on how to use existing apps for itself. The large action model, or LAM, was trained by humans interacting with apps like Spotify and Uber, essentially showing the model how they work. The LAM learned what a Settings icon looked like, how to know when an order was confirmed, and where the search menus are. All that, Lyu says, can be applied to any app anywhere.\n\nThe R1 also has a dedicated training mode, which you can use to teach the device how to do something, and it will supposedly be able to repeat the action on its own going forward. Lyu gives an example: “You’ll be like, ‘Hey, first of all, go to a software called Photoshop. Open it. Grab your photos here. Make a lasso on the watermark and click click click click. This is how you remove watermark.’” It takes 30 seconds for Rabbit OS to process, Lyu says, and then it can automatically remove all your watermarks going forward.\n\nHow all of this actually works in practice, though, is the real question. You’ll be able to do some things on the R1 itself, and there’s a web portal called Rabbit Hole through which you log in to all your various services. And if you want to, say, teach the device how to use Photoshop, you’ll be able to boot one of Rabbit’s virtual machines and teach it there rather than using your own device and software. But how that will work with lots of users, on lots of devices and platforms, will be tricky to get right.\n\n\"What ChatGPT could be to web search, Rabbit OS could be to the app store\"\n\nRabbit’s approach here is pretty clever. Getting anyone to support a new operating system is tough, even if you’re a tech giant, and the LAM way subverts that by just teaching the model how to use apps. More broadly, we’re seeing a rash of new AI-powered hardware coming to the market, but too often, all those gadgets do is connect to a chatbot. Rabbit is, by contrast, more like a super app — a single interface through which you can do just about anything. What ChatGPT could be to web search, Rabbit OS could be to the app store. There are a thousand complications and caveats to that dream, of course, but it’s an interesting dream.\n\nListening to Lyu talk about Rabbit OS and the R1, though, it’s not entirely clear what the company’s vision for this device really is. It’s not nearly powerful enough to replace your phone, though it can make video calls and does have a slot for a SIM card. It’s primarily a voice assistant, but the device has a screen and a camera. It’s not just a voice assistant... but it does a lot of voice assistant things. Rabbit says it has designed Rabbit OS with security and privacy in mind, but it is also asking you to log in to some of your most used services through its interface. The R1, in Lyu’s view, is both a nifty accessory and the all-in-one future of pretty much everything. \n\nThe R1 is available for preorder now, and Lyu says the device will start shipping in March. He even thinks, and maybe hopes, he might beat Humane’s AI Pin to market.\n\nUpdate January 9th, 2:40PM ET: Added keynote video, a gallery of images, and some new information on how the R1 works.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"EcoFlow’s scalable solar generator can power your entire home or just a weekend away","alternativeHeadline":"The modular Delta Pro Ultra can automatically switch circuits over to battery power during blackouts, scaling from a few hours of backup to a month or longer when prioritizing circuits.","datePublished":"2024-01-09T18:24:10.135Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T18:24:10.135Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/23996517/ecoflow-delta-pro-ultra-solar-generator-home-backup-price-specs","author":[],"articleBody":"The Delta Pro Ultra is EcoFlow’s upgraded answer to US power outages that have been made worse by a surge in extreme weather. In the event of a blackout, the scalable battery solution can seamlessly switch over and provide days of backup power for your entire home or for more than a month if only powering your essential devices. \n\nThe Delta Pro Ultra isn’t just for emergencies, though. It can be configured with up to 16.8kW of total solar input to intelligently offset daily energy costs at home or act as a solar generator to continuously power an off-grid cabin or job site. It’s also portable enough to toss into a vehicle for any occasion that requires a big-ass battery. \n\n[Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMpYUGev6zI]\n\nThe basic Delta Pro Ultra kit consists of two stackable units. On top is the inverter box capable of 7200W (10.8kW for up to 10 seconds) AC output with support for up to 5.6kW of solar input; below the inverter is a 6kWh LFP battery pack which is automatically heated to maintain performance in cold climates. You can stack up to five batteries under a single inverter and connect up to three inverters to EcoFlow’s new Smart Home Panel 2 subpanel for up to 90kWh of capacity, up to 16.8kW of solar input to keep those batteries charged, and up to 21.6kW of AC output. That’s enough to power almost any household appliance, including powerful central air conditioners.\n\nAnd if you own an EV, the Delta Pro Ultra can charge it for a few extra miles of range in a pinch and can even be charged from a Level 2 EV charging station in about two hours with an EcoFlow adapter sold separately.\n\n[Image: Can power individual devices while providing backup power to your home circuits. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/18GCK6OW-Risi_RKXLDUZX8xlAo=/0x0:8877x4999/8877x4999/filters:focal(4439x2500:4440x2501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151408/Washing_Room_DPU_SHP2_PowerInsight.jpg]\n[Image: Your neighbors are going to love your lawn solar. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JDoNqjetQvs92X50_7f3j6zrDyk=/0x0:8000x4500/8000x4500/filters:focal(4000x2250:4001x2251)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151395/Garden_DPU_Solar_Panels.png]\n[Image: More cozy than a fireplace. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sF-jQm-E0kPduy9aWeY6eVnUMvM=/0x0:6500x3656/6500x3656/filters:focal(3250x1828:3251x1829)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151396/Living_Room_2_DPU_Single_Machine_Use.png]\n[Image: We’ll leave the lights on for ya. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VynIfCgb5q6aPOb3yiHG6I0CP5M=/0x0:6000x3375/6000x3375/filters:focal(3000x1688:3001x1689)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151397/Garage_2_DPU_50_Amp_Hub.png]\n[Image: Frankenstein’s Silicon Valley startup garage. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FrLPA-Qc0hJUQoa2Iy05cA8yhaw=/0x0:6000x3375/6000x3375/filters:focal(3000x1688:3001x1689)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151399/Whole_House_1.png]\n[Image: Now you’re just showing off. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owQJVDI8Sojce3BmHlYREhiOttg=/0x0:5000x2820/5000x2820/filters:focal(2500x1410:2501x1411)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151403/Living_Room_1_DPU_SHP2.png]\n[Image: Smart Home Panel 2. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cV02pYB64z3S4xSwYXJWJzs9jws=/0x0:2560x1440/2560x1440/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151411/Smart_Home_Panel_2_Right_view.png]\n[Image: The inverter. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lK_3a1GpcD4uEBjN1SeAeANOs3Q=/0x0:3238x1996/3238x1996/filters:focal(1619x998:1620x999)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151412/Inverter_Right_view.png]\n[Image: The inverter plus battery. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h_phKphBMiXxCuogj2YeEQEn-xs=/0x0:3238x1996/3238x1996/filters:focal(1619x998:1620x999)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151413/Battery_Inverter_Front_view.png]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aCgJZmyGPzlQyecGwIkqgNCWlSU=/0x0:4000x2665/4000x2665/filters:focal(2000x1333:2001x1334)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151415/Battery_Left_view.png]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/80b1i93vLd4X-toVwJ6y2W5Dryo=/0x0:6000x3454/6000x3454/filters:focal(3000x1727:3001x1728)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151416/Battery_Inverter_Trolly_Front_view.png]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gMxsRgJBARLxRvn1sK_-d6r-vss=/0x0:780x1688/780x1688/filters:focal(390x844:391x845)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25156446/Operating_Mode_TOU_Mode.png]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/it7uwr6ruAqkngLK_5uXVhjjF6I=/0x0:780x1688/780x1688/filters:focal(390x844:391x845)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25156447/Operating_Mode_Self_Power.png]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FIllCAKMbR2UppCkAvmilrgzYrw=/0x0:1170x2532/1170x2532/filters:focal(585x1266:586x1267)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25156448/DPU_Main_Page.png]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GTTj7LNPXDEPQixC58iJKKsqA90=/0x0:1170x2532/1170x2532/filters:focal(585x1266:586x1267)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25156449/Circuit_Priorities.png]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RXmCBvVGMufYARWHPTxJXqbR_3g=/0x0:1170x2532/1170x2532/filters:focal(585x1266:586x1267)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25156450/DPU_Charging.png]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t8Ujl-DyBd9nxkRce1iXABB4On0=/0x0:212x675/212x675/filters:focal(106x338:107x339)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25156451/Operating_Mode.png]\n\nEcoFlow says 90kWh is enough stored energy to keep your home’s essential items like lights and refrigerator running for over 30 days in a blackout — not the entire home. According to the US Energy Information Administration, the average US home consumed 889kWh per month in 2022, or about 29.2kWh per day.\n\nEcoFlow’s Smart Home Panel 2 requires professional installation by any certified electrician. It then lets you identify which circuits to prioritize for rapid (20ms) automatic switchover to the Delta Pro Ultra(s) in case of an outage. It also features an intelligent time-of-use mode that can help lower energy bills by using solar power to offset peak energy rates. And like Tesla’s Powerwall, it has a storm alert feature that will make sure your batteries are fully charged if a major storm is in the forecast.\n\nThe Delta Pro Ultra can also connect to your home via an inlet box or transfer switch and be charged with a 7200W diesel generator you might already have or EcoFlow’s own dual-fuel Smart Generator. EcoFlow says that the Delta Pro Ultra can’t be used to connect to and feed energy back to the grid.\n\n[Image: Roll it into the shed where it’ll power all your tools. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LoyxGy-N1hqkuu6fuY7xW_cofSA=/0x0:6665x4999/6665x4999/filters:focal(3333x2500:3334x2501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151409/Tool_Room_DPU_Circular_Saw_achine.jpg]\n\nFor standalone use, the Delta Pro Ultra’s inverter unit comes packed with outlets. These include two 100W USB-Cs, two USB-As for your older devices, four regular 120V / 20A AC outlets, one 120V 30A outlet for RV use, and a split-phase 120V / 240V 30A NEMA outlet for high-wattage devices like a welder or compressor. It accepts up to 1600W of low-voltage (3-150V, 15A) solar input and 4000W of high-voltage (80-450V, 15A) solar input via two integrated MC4 connectors for access to large solar arrays. It can also be configured with a 4G modem so that you can monitor your Delta Pro Ultra device from anywhere, when EcoFlow’s home Wi-Fi and direct Bluetooth connectivity aren’t enough.\n\n[Image: Detach it from the Smart Home Panel 2 and bring that big-ass battery with you. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwPiVnCKwLV4jwOKlXDkye4wtl8=/0x0:6665x4999/6665x4999/filters:focal(3333x2500:3334x2501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151405/Outdoor_DPU_Trolley.jpg]\n\nFortunately, the Delta Pro Ultra kit comes with a rolling base that, judging by the photos, can support the 70-pound / 31.7kg inverter and up to five 116.4-pound / 50.7kg stackable batteries. EcoFlow’s solution is also expected to be quieter than similar systems thanks to a new “X-Cooling” liquid-cooling system that runs silently when generating less than 2000W. Delta Pro Ultra has an IP54 rating, making it dustproof and splashproof.\n\nExtreme weather is the primary cause of power outages due to the stress it puts on the already overloaded and aging US electrical grid. Since 2011, the average annual number of weather-related power outages has increased by almost 80 percent, according to the US Department of Energy. The average US home went without power for about seven hours in 2021, increasing to almost 19 hours in states like West Virginia and 80 hours in Louisiana. \n\nEcoFlow is targeting the US market with today’s launch, having previously addressed the European market with the launch of the PowerStream and PowerOcean. The Delta Pro Ultra kit combined with a Smart Home Panel 2 replaces the a la carte whole-home backup bundles the company was selling in the US last year.\n\n[Image: If you can afford this house and car, then the Delta Pro Ultra whole-home backup might be for you. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fo6L2e1_-e7f6WH9VFF0bZQXMxE=/0x0:6500x3656/6500x3656/filters:focal(3250x1828:3251x1829)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25151400/Whole_House_2.png]\n\nThe cost of a single Delta Pro Ultra kit (inverter plus one battery) is $5,799, plus $3,299 for each additional battery and $2,799 for each additional inverter. The Smart Home Panel 2 costs $1,899. So you’re looking at well over $50K for a fully maxed out system, and that’s before adding in the cost of labor and any solar panels (and deducting any available tax credits). \n\nSo yeah, whole-home backup solutions like this — or Anker’s similar but less capable new Solix system — aren’t cheap. But for people who can afford the types of houses depicted in EcoFlow’s promotional images, the prospect of uninterrupted power and a modicum of energy independence could be worth the expense.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"The Skyted mask looks ridiculous but might actually make sense!","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T18:15:15.277Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T18:15:15.277Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031729/the-skyted-mask-looks-ridiculous-but-might-actually-make-sense","author":[],"articleBody":"Want to have private convos in public, perhaps without disturbing fellow airplane passengers?

They’re both OLED, with resolutions of up to 2880 x 1800, aspect ratios of 16:10, and a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz. Between them, they offer a total of 19.8 inches of usable screen real estate.\n\nIt’s a similar approach to the one Lenovo took with last year’s dual-screen Yoga Book 9i, albeit with a couple of tweaks. Like Lenovo, Asus gives you a choice of typing on the lower touchscreen via a virtual keyboard or by using a detachable physical Bluetooth keyboard. But what’s different here is that Asus’ keyboard has a trackpad built in, so you don’t have to use it in combination with an on-screen trackpad. \n\n[Media: https://youtu.be/NC6dUAWslnk?feature=shared\u0026t=20]\n\nAsus envisages you using the new Zenbook Duo in a few different configurations. There’s a standard laptop mode, where the bottom screen is entirely covered by a traditional keyboard and trackpad. Or you can rest the keyboard on your desk and have the two screens arranged vertically for “Dual Screen” mode or horizontally for “Desktop” mode. Finally, there’s “Sharing” mode, which has you ditch the keyboard entirely and lay the laptop down on a flat surface with both its screens facing up and away from each other, presumably so you can share your work with a colleague sitting across the desk from you.\n\n[Image: With its Bluetooth keyboard attached, you could almost mistake the Zenbook Duo for a regular laptop. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SK5tdtGjy_32KLscQrk0Q7PuZCM=/0x0:2700x1800/2700x1800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212418/246951_Asus_Zenbook_Duo_ABenedetto_0246.jpg]\n[Image: Asus has built the laptop’s trackpad into its physical Bluetooth keyboard. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9cOUxAso7fttPzwerjuNQOWYEvs=/0x0:2700x1800/2700x1800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212416/246951_Asus_Zenbook_Duo_ABenedetto_0221.jpg]\n\nNaturally, having launched a year later than its competitor, the Asus Zenbook Duo is also packed with more modern hardware. It can be specced with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and 32GB of RAM, up to 2TB of storage, and a 75Wh battery. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a USB-A port, HDMI out, and a 3.5mm jack, and the laptop can be used with Asus’ stylus. The Bluetooth keyboard is designed to be carried between the two screens when the laptop isn’t in use and can charge by attaching to pogo pins on the edges of the lower screen.\n\n[Image: Here’s how Dual Screen mode looks from the side. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TkO_SS40FSo1Drogbg_qmzacn5E=/0x0:2700x1800/2700x1800/filters:focal(1350x900:1351x901)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212414/246951_Asus_Zenbook_Duo_ABenedetto_0174.jpg]\n\nThe Zenbook Duo (2024) is just one of the many laptops Asus has at CES this year. Alongside it, the company has new Vivobook laptops, including the 15.6-inch Vivobook Pro 15 OLED, which can be specced with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor alongside a dedicated Nvidia RTX GPU as well as up to 24GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. It also has 15- and 16-inch Vivobook S series laptops, which are also available with OLED screens and come with a choice of the latest Intel and AMD processors but no mention of dedicated GPUs.\n\nFinally, there’s a handful of TUF-branded gaming laptops, including new TUF Gaming F16, A16, and A15 models. The F16 has an Intel Core i7 13650HX processor and Nvidia RTX 4060 GPU, while the A16 gets you an AMD Ryzen 9 7845HX and RTX 4070. Both have a choice of 16-inch 165Hz LCD displays (though exact resolutions vary), up to 32GB RAM, and 2TB storage. Meanwhile, the smaller TUF Gaming A15 is available with an AMD Ryzen 8000-series processor with an RTX 4070 GPU, a 15-inch 2.5K LCD display with a 165Hz refresh rate, up to 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage. All three laptops can be upgraded with more RAM and storage.\n\nThe Zenbook Duo (2024) is expected to start at $1,499 in the US, while in the UK and Europe prices start at £1,699.99 and €2,099.99. Meanwhile, in the UK, the Vivobook Pro 15 OLED and Vivobook S series will start at £1,599.99 (around $2,034) and £999.99 (around $1,271) respectively (we’ve followed up for official US pricing information).\n\nUpdate January 10th, 3:21AM ET: Updated with US pricing and release information for the Zenbook Duo.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Google Chrome is coming to your car","alternativeHeadline":"Google is adding the Chrome browser to cars with native Android apps, starting with Volvo and Polestar.

This feature will be OS agnostic, so anyone with an iPhone or Android device can use it. \n\n“Google built-in” is the company’s marketing term for Google Automotive Services (GAS), which is the licensed product that it sells to car companies that want to have certain features, like Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Google Play Store, as the default on their infotainment screens. GAS runs on top of Android Automotive, which is when the native operating system of the vehicle runs on Android. \n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hNZqbuZUYV75ODYGHTImNcA7Bs=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212753/Google_Chome_Browser_Still.jpg]\n\nChrome browsing is also coming to certain vehicles with Android Automotive, starting with certain Volvo and Polestar vehicles. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said the company had been “waiting a long time” for Chrome browsing to come to its cars, offering the Vivaldi browser as a holdover until it was ready. \n\n“This is now, of course, a much more convenient solution,” Ingenlath said in an interview. “The Chrome browser, it’s connected to your account and has all the knowledge about your preferences and everything. So that becomes a nice feature.”\n\nGoogle is also adding new apps to cars with Google built-in, including video streaming services like PBS Kids, Crunchyroll, and The Weather Channel app. \n\nThe company has been adding new features to both Android Auto and Google built-in pretty steadily over the past few years. The new features come at an uncertain time for in-car software, with safety experts warning about distracting interfaces and major automakers like GM restricting access to phone-mirroring programs like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Quick Share for all and ecosystem upgrades: Google’s CES 2024 news","alternativeHeadline":"Google’s CES announcements are all about togetherness, like casting TikTok to your TV and a new unified Quick Share in partnership with Samsung.","datePublished":"2024-01-09T18:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T18:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24030353/google-quick-share-tiktok-home-hub-matter-lg-tv-chromecast","author":[],"articleBody":"Modern digital life comes with a great many gadgets — and those gadgets are often loath to work together. Nowhere is that more apparent than the OLED-paneled halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center during CES, where Google is announcing some small efforts to get the wide constellation of gadgets in its ecosystem talking to each other a little more easily. Android’s AirDrop-like sharing feature is combining forces with Samsung, LG smart TVs are getting smart home updates, and TikTok is coming to Chromecast, among other things.\n\nWe were tipped off late last year that one of these features was coming, but it’s official now: Android’s Nearby Share will adopt the same name as Samsung’s sharing protocol and become Quick Share. That’s welcome news for people using Samsung phones, who will no longer face the confusing choice of two very similar sharing options, and Quick Share functionality will remain the same for them. As for non-Samsung Android phones, the new Quick Share will add support for formerly Samsung-only features like sharing files with multiple contacts simultaneously for compatible devices.\n\nGoogle is working with LG to integrate the new Quick Share into future Windows PCs, and the formerly Nearby Share app will continue to be available for download — now as Quick Share — for other platforms.\n\n[Image: Quick Share: coming to an Android phone near you. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_izOSneagcFObLNypYg6lKawnio=/0x0:2000x960/2000x960/filters:focal(1000x480:1001x481)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213087/Image_2_Quick_Share.jpg]\n\nGoogle’s support for smart displays has dwindled in recent history, so the announcement that new LG TVs will be able to act as Google Home hubs is a welcome one. They’ll support Matter over Wi-Fi so you can link up your smart devices. Google tells us that some older TVs will get an update that will enable this functionality, too, but didn’t give us any specifics on models. LG’s 2024 TVs, in the meantime, will come equipped with Chromecast.\n\nOther updates are coming to Chromecast, which will soon be able to cast content from the TikTok app to your TV. Fast Pair will support quickly pairing headphones to your TV via Chromecast with Google TV. And Pixel phone owners will also be able to take advantage of a new HomePod-esque interaction with the Pixel Tablet, too. When you’re listening to a podcast or music on your Pixel phone, you’ll be able to transfer playback just by tapping the phone to the docked tablet. This will only work with Spotify and YouTube Music at launch, and only with the Pixel Tablet, but Google VP of engineering Erik Kay says that the company is “definitely looking to bring this feature to more devices over time.”\n\nSomething else Kay says we should see in the future? More collaborations with Samsung — a partner and competitor — like this mashup of Nearby Share and Quick Share. Samsung is teasing next week’s Unpacked with visuals suggesting integrations with Google AI. Can the two companies team up to take the fight to Apple? Kay didn’t comment on this exactly but conceded that the two companies have been “working together even more closely” and said we should “expect more of that to come.” Intriguing, but something tells me we won’t be seeing Bixby on a Pixel phone anytime soon.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Asus targets Apple’s Vision Pro (with M2) with the AirVision M1","alternativeHeadline":"Asus’ wearable screen isn’t a VR headset, but the name certainly reminds us of one.","datePublished":"2024-01-09T18:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T18:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031135/asus-air-vision-m1-wearable-display-glasses-screen","author":[],"articleBody":"Asus has screens aplenty at this year’s CES, including one for your face. The AirVision M1 is a pair of glasses housing a wearable display, which shows content from a connected phone or computer. The glasses include a 1080p Micro OLED display with a 57-degree vertical perspective field of view, making it a sizable screen in front of your eyeballs. \n\nThe AirVision M1 might sound familiar, even beyond the fact that it sounds like an Apple product in three different ways. TCL makes similar glasses: the NXTWear S and more recent S Plus. Like NXTWear, Asus’ glasses offer built-in speakers and use a wired connection to pipe content to the screen over DisplayPort. But the AirVision adds a couple of interesting new features: There’s a touchpad embedded on the left temple so you can make adjustments to the display. You can also pin the virtual screen in a specific location. \n\n[Image: I mean, even this mannequin looks awkward wearing them. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LyuFU_hYU1AHoQt9sHnWyYR07O8=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213984/ASUS_AirVision_M1_Wearable_Display_Business.png]\n\nIf Asus’ renders are anything to judge by, then there’s an issue both the NXTWear and AirVision suffer from: they both look, well, kinda doofy. They’re bulky, because they have to be, and there’s no way these things are passing for traditional glasses. They’re not meant to be worn all the time, but even for a short session on a plane or a coffee shop, they need to abide by the first rule of wearables: you have to want to wear them.\n\nAsus hasn’t revealed pricing or availability for the AirVision. For reference, TCL’s glasses cost $399, so something in that ballpark would be expected.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Asus made a big portable OLED monitor you can fold in half","alternativeHeadline":"Along with a high-resolution screen, the monitor also comes with USB-C and Mini HDMI ports.","datePublished":"2024-01-09T18:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T18:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24030378/asus-zenscreen-fold-oled-ces-2024","author":[],"articleBody":"If you’re a multitasker who wishes you could carry around a second screen without being weighed down, soon, you might be able to. At CES this week, Asus introduced its first foldable OLED monitor, designed to be lugged around without breaking your back or bag.\n\nPositioned as a productivity tool for working on the go, Asus’ ZenScreen Fold OLED monitor features a 17.3-inch screen that could function well as a second display. At the same time, though, it conveniently folds up like a book for easy storage, with a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5-like waterdrop-style hinge to reduce the visibility of the screen crease. And with a profile as thin as 9.7mm when unfolded, it can slip into a bag fairly easily. The whole package weighs 2.65 pounds, which should be manageable in a bag, assuming your laptop is light enough. \n\nMy colleague Sean Hollister got to see it in person at CES this week, and those claims seem to stand up.

Asus also claims it covers 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color space and meets the DisplayHDR True Black 500 spec, all of which means it should come with rich colors and deep blacks. It looked great in person, though we weren’t able to raise its brightness above the 80 percent mark. \n\n[Image: Asus positions the ZenScreen Fold OLED (MQ17QH) as a productivity-oriented monitor, but you could technically also use it to game with a friend. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UMNkF57uz8wTgcZFsIyu0VoVI0=/0x0:8640x5760/8640x5760/filters:focal(4320x2880:4321x2881)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212997/ASUS_ZenScreen_Fold_OLED_MQ17QH_Scenario8.jpg]\n\nIn terms of connectivity, the monitor comes with two USB-C ports as well as a Mini HDMI port, along with a tripod hole. That means you can use the screen with a variety of devices, ranging from laptops to digital cameras.\n\n[Media: https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7322162239388142878?is_from_webapp=1\u0026sender_device=pc\u0026web_id=7197522361686984235]\n\nAsus didn’t share when the monitor will be available or how much it’ll cost.\n\nThe Asus ZenScreen Fold OLED wasn’t the only screen capturing attention at this year’s CES. Asus also debuted a new dual-screen OLED laptop, the revamped Zenbook Duo. The 14-inch laptop comes with two 120Hz OLED touchscreens that can expand up to 19.8 inches, along with a removable keyboard.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Spotted the Asus ROG NUC micro gaming PC — and here’s a mouse for scale.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T17:52:40.580Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T17:52:40.580Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031688/spotted-the-asus-rog-nuc-micro-gaming-pc-and-heres-a-mouse-for-scale","author":[],"articleBody":"It’s good to see Intel’s gaming NUCs are alive and well under new management!

Nomad announced a $100 Qi2 charger, but it doesn’t include the required 20W adapter and only charges a single device. Mophie announced its first Qi2 stands back in September, pricing its 3-in-1 option around $130 as well. And Belkin’s Qi2 3-in-1 charging pad comes in at the same price.

Users will interact with it on the TV’s second (lower) screen, and the company says it “will come to know and recognize the Telly owner” over time and offer personalized recommendations to users. The company didn’t say when the feature will be available.\n\nThe existing SoundHound-powered voice assistant is limited to more mundane tasks like setting timers, changing picture modes, or answering simple questions.\n\n[Image: Telly’s assistant can offer Taylor Swift tickets to you. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UnZp4Sl-L0fx7CuD9MuMT0z0VTI=/0x0:1280x720/1280x720/filters:focal(640x360:641x361)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214419/tellyai_tour.png]\n\nTelly also says other household users can opt to have the chatbot personalized to them, offering the example of a chatbot that knows you’re on a vegetarian diet and keeps that in mind when you ask for restaurant recommendations. The announcement says that the goal is for the assistant to make the TV “a valuable, interactive family member.” \n\n[Image: The second screen is the star of Telly’s show. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dTQ6ZB85a7_PMd9Pk8MVvho7LeU=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24696602/DSCF1027_Enhanced_NR.jpg]\n\nTelly didn’t get specific about how its TV is doing other than to say it’s shipped “thousands” of them to customers. The company is at CES 2024 to pitch its TV’s advertising performance, telling brands that usage is “more than twice the national hourly average” and that viewers remembered the ads on its second screen more than those in traditional commercial breaks. The company cited a more than 60 percent recall rate for a Kia ad campaign it ran. \n\n“We’re transforming the biggest screen in the home into the most powerful retail channel since the internet,” said Ilya Pozin, Telly’s CEO.\n\nThe new pitch about using AI for personalization is one we’re hearing across CES this year as we dive into a second year with ChatGPT and companies start to figure out how they’re going to make chatbots a part of their products. (See LG’s “Affectionate Intelligence” or Samsung’s latest Ballie concept.) Telly’s chatbot might be useful, but it will probably help along the company’s plan to use the TV to gather your data and sell you things, which it hasn’t been coy about. \n\n[Media: https://megaphone.link/VMP4470040847]\n\nTelly also says that using the TV’s integrated camera for Zoom calls has been a hit with early users and announced a new “Zoom Watch Party” feature that puts it on the second screen, letting you watch content or play video games on the main screen while you video chat on the second screen using its integrated camera. \n\nMeanwhile, T-Commerce is the name for its promised purchasing feature. When users interact with an ad on the second screen, they’ll be taken to a web browser for the retailer, with the option to save their payment info to the TV for easy checkouts. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Lamborghini will measure your heart rate as you burn rubber around the track","alternativeHeadline":"Wealthy supercar owners can now record their best track runs for remote coaches to watch in real time.

I can see this being helpful to racing amateurs who see their supercars as more than just expensive toys. Lamborghini sees it as “ensuring fun driving based on a user-friendly approach.”\n\nIf you’d rather keep track of your own blood pressure, Lamborghini is also introducing Biometric Data System, which captures the driver’s biometric data, “including heart rate and stress level, to allow more in-depth performance monitoring and provide useful references on how they can refine their training.” \n\nThe biometric data is gathered through a prototype wearable device, a Lamborghini spokesperson said. “The wearable device helps explore the different possibilities of bio-metric sensors and data streaming technology to anticipate what could be possible in the future,” he added.\n\n\"“heart rate and stress level”\"\n\nSome racecar drivers have been known to monitor their physical performance when they race around the track. They use biometric devices to map heart rate, body temperature, oxygen levels, stress, and fatigue. The world’s fastest cars can also be incredible stressful to handle, especially at neck-snapping speeds. The downforce alone can top 1,000lbs, making it a feat of strength to navigate a vehicle as fast as a Lamborghini Huracan around the track. \n\nRace and driver data are sent to the vehicle’s Digital Co-Pilot, which the company describes as a “proactive voice assistant.” (Props to Lamborghini for not saying anything about AI in its release, despite obvious temptation.)\n\n“For example, the Digital Co-Pilot analyzes lap times and provides useful pointers for improving racing lines and braking points, as well as information on the performance of the car on the track,” the company says. \n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MxChLyPJmZdJ8XeJI7HKS7HRfDM=/0x0:3840x2160/3840x2160/filters:focal(1920x1080:1921x1081)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213426/Lamborghini_Telemetry_X__6_.jpg]\n\nLamborghini first introduced its telemetry feature with the Huracán STO in 2020. Drivers could track their stats using the company’s Unica mobile app. \n\nPeople already let their smartwatches monitor their heart beat and blood oxygen levels, so there’s no reason to think they would object to letting their sports car do the same. Especially when you consider the Venn diagram of people who own Apple Watches and people who own Lamborghinis is probably just a circle. \n\nLamborghini is on track to deliver its first hybrid sports car to customers this year, followed by its first all-electric one in 2028. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Swarovski Optik intros smart binoculars for the lazy birder.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T16:46:58.748Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T16:46:58.748Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031524/swarovski-optik-intros-smart-binoculars-for-the-lazy-birder","author":[],"articleBody":"As a very amateur birder, I’ve had times when I spent over half an hour paging through a book or working with an app trying to identify a bird sitting on a branch or in a marsh several yards away.\n\nAt CES 2024, Swarovski, one of the best optic manufacturers around, has announced the Ax Visio AI-supported 10 x 32 binoculars, which, according to the company, can help you identify over 9,000 birds.

The webcam support will include both the front- and rear-facing cameras, and the ability to apply background blur and auto-framing to your camera feed.\n\nGoogle added similar webcam support to a December Android 14 update, but reports from some Pixel owners suggest that Windows isn’t always correctly detecting the webcam feature.\n\n[Image: Samsung is promising more Copilot integration in the future. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xv3rk8fvi0mIWx5ZkZw3IHInf70=/0x0:1588x884/1588x884/filters:focal(794x442:795x443)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25214148/VWnyNsL.png]\n\nSamsung is also working with Microsoft to integrate Copilot into its Android and Windows-based devices. “From March this year, Galaxy Book 4 and Galaxy smartphone owners will be able to experience the incredible new capabilities supported by Microsoft Copilot,” says Gabrio. “Simply connect your Galaxy Book 4 and Galaxy smartphone with Link to Windows to find, read, or summarize text messages.”\n\nThe Copilot integration will also support automatic message draft creation “based on your prior usage” and the ability to send messages directly from a PC. “We’re planning even more ways to bring Copilot features to Galaxy devices, so stay tuned,” says Gabrio.\n\nSamsung is also part of many PC makers that are adding Microsoft’s new Copilot key to its laptop keyboards.

TP-Link says the fingerprint scanner can unlock the device in less than a second and that it also includes a built-in door sensor so you can check if it’s open or not.\n\nThe Tapo DL130’s camera films at 2K resolution with a 180-degree field of view. It has a built-in spotlight for color night vision and a speaker that can play prerecorded responses to visitors. TP-Link debuted a similar video door lock last year, though that one only worked with Google’s and Amazon’s smart home platforms. \n\nTP-Link isn’t the only company with video door locks — Lockly’s Vision Elite, which The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy reviewed in 2022 lacks Home Key support and offered only so-so video performance, but she found it otherwise solid.

Last year, Nanoleaf’s Essentials Matter Smart Holiday String Lights made it to our list of the best holiday smart string lights, but the Philips Hue Festavia string lights were ultimately our top choice. That’s in part because of how limited Nanoleaf’s ecosystem was when it comes to outdoor lights, rendering them better for decorating Christmas trees than big outdoor displays. With these new lights, the game could change.\n\n[Image: Nanoleaf’s Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights will be available this spring. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/COlcjJWTFS019O9O4-T1RkfpByA=/0x0:4000x2250/4000x2250/filters:focal(2000x1125:2001x1126)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25206404/OutdoorLightStrips_Balcony_4000x2250px__1_.jpg]\n\nLike the other products in the Matter Essentials line, the new outdoor lights are Matter-compatible, so they can work with a range of major smart home platforms, including Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings. As a result, you can easily control the lights via most voice assistants and Matter-compatible apps, in addition to Nanoleaf’s app over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and remote.\n\nNanoleaf says the new lights also integrate with other Nanoleaf products. That means you can group them with your indoor lights and automate them with schedules via the Matter app. The lights also come with a new set of preset lighting scenes, in addition to the thousands of other scenes available in the Nanoleaf app. \n\n[Image: The Nanoleaf Skylight Smart Modular Ceiling Light will be available very soon. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhQq-UUY4BGzxKBtwe0bED9bVSo=/0x0:4000x4000/4000x4000/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24322383/Nanoleaf_Skylight_7x_Dining_Room_RGB.jpg]\n\nWhile the outdoor lights may have stolen the spotlight, the Skylight Smart Modular Ceiling Light once again captured some attention this year. After first introducing the fixture at CES 2023, Nanoleaf finally shared that the ceiling light will be available later this month.\n\nDesigned to mimic a roof skylight, the square LED ceiling panels come with preset scenes like “Gentle Rain” or “Sun Shower” and work with Matter. Like Nanoleaf’s wall panels, they can also change colors and sync with sound but are hardwired. The three-pack Smarter Kit is available for preorder now from go.nanoleaf.me for $249.99, while the expansion packs start at $69.99.\n\nNanoleaf introduced a couple of other new products and capabilities during this year’s CES. The company unveiled its first color-changing addressable indoor light strip, the Smart Multicolor Lightstrip. Like the outdoor lights, they also work with Matter and will be available in the spring. \n\nLast but not least, Nanoleaf also introduced its new Orchestrator software.

It comes with the territory — especially when we’re talking about ambitious health tech that requires regulatory clearance. So it was really neat that after two years, I got to actually hold Movano’s Evie smart ring in my hands ahead of the first wave of units shipping out to customers later this month.\n\nThe Evie Ring’s approach to health tracking has a twist. With wearables, women often feel like an afterthought in design. Just look at smartwatches. Usually, companies prioritize bigger sizes to extend battery life at the expense of those with smaller wrists. The Evie Ring, however, is one of the few woman-first wearables, and that clearly shows up in the design.\n\nHolding the ring in hand, you can see it has an open gap that slightly flexes to account for finger swelling — something that can happen in warmer temperatures or as a result of hormonal changes. From an engineering standpoint, that’s actually pretty impressive given the number of sensors and flexible batteries that you need to stuff into such a tiny form factor. \n\nI also dig that it has an actual case, kind of like earbuds. The Oura Ring comes with a small charging stand, and my cats have knocked it — and therefore the ring — off my nightstand and under my bed one too many times. Movano says that the ring itself has an estimated battery life of roughly four days, and that the case itself holds up to 10 full charges. \n\n[Image: There’s a small gap so that the ring can flex and fit comfortably when your fingers are swollen. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VN-UYZs_Al-mhLeE3QTPKtx_nSs=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212486/eviering1.jpg]\n\nMeanwhile, the companion app also includes period tracking and mood logging, which will eventually power AI-based insights based on correlations between menstrual health, hormones, energy, sleep, and activity.\n\nStacy Salvi, Movano Health’s vice president of product and strategy, says the company’s built an AI framework that will allow it to pull insights from different types of data. “So if a woman experiences more restless sleep during the luteal phase per cycle, we’re going to point that out. Some people actually experience better sleep during their cycle and so we’d point that, too. We have actually have different insights on each of those.” \n\nSince Movano is a smaller company, those types of insights will at first rely on users logging moods. Once enough of a database is built up, then those AI insights will come a lot more naturally with time, Salvi says. Other planned features include a health report that can be shared with doctors, automatic activity detection for workouts, and Android support in the second quarter of the year. (At first, the Evie Ring will be iOS only.) \n\nAt launch, the ring will be able to do both spot checks and passive overnight readings for SpO2, or blood oxygen. That’s fairly standard for wearables these days, but the more compelling thing to me is that Movano has made it a point to use medical-grade sensors, build the device at a medical device manufacturing facility, and seek FDA clearance for its pulse oximeter. \n\n[Image: The Evie Ring first showed up at CES in 2022. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KASP4KbpDt_5uLiB2GcgSewiit0=/0x0:2040x1360/2040x1360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212490/eviering3.jpg]\n\nAs far as FDA clearance goes, technically Movano still hasn’t gotten it. The company filed for 510(k) clearance in summer 2023 for blood oxygen and heart rate and is in the process of going back and forth to address concerns. That said, that won’t mean the Evie will launch with any features missing. Movano spokesperson Matt Bevenour says FDA clearance is merely to show users that the Evie Ring meets the regulator’s standards for accuracy. Once clearance is granted, Movano plans to transition from a wellness to medical device.\n\n“It’s going really well. We’re in communication with the FDA, and we’re looking forward to getting that cleared,” Salvi says. She says that, so far, the ring has exceeded FDA standards in testing. \n\n“The DNA of the company is medical-based,” Salvi says, pointing to Movano CEO John Mastrototaro’s background in helping to create the very first continuous glucose monitor. Salvi also noted that getting clearance presents future business opportunities as the line between wearables and medical devices blurs further.\n\nThe Evie Ring is available for iOS users to buy now. It’ll cost $269 with no subscription and comes in gold, silver, and rose gold. Shipping is slated to start later this month.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"I watched the Matic robovac suck up a glass of milk.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T14:30:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T14:30:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031329/i-watched-the-matic-robo-vac-suck-up-a-glass-of-milk","author":[],"articleBody":"This Wall-E-esque robot vacuum and mop made a trip to The Verge’s CES hotel room to show off its unique skills, including cleaning up liquids.\n\nIt ably sucked up milk off the hard floor and cereal from the carpet, but its most surprising feature in our demo was how quiet it was... just 55db.\n\nThe $1,800 robovac’s speed and maneuverability were also impressive, responding on the fly to obstacles and moving almost... gracefully?! \n\nThere are still some kinks to work out, but it’s a promising evolution of the run-of-the-mill robovac.\n\n[Attachment: https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7321537979942505758]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Alexa can now talk like a personal trainer or Socrates.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T14:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T14:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24030567/alexa-can-now-talk-like-a-personal-trainer-or-socrates","author":[],"articleBody":"Thanks to a partnership with AI company Character.AI, Alexa users can have “just-for-fun” conversations with different personas made from Character.AI’s models.\n\nYou can get book recommendations from a character called Librarian Linda, speak with a pretend version of Socrates, or get fitness tips from a personal trainer character.

Just open the Prime Video app on your phone or tablet, tap the cast button, and alongside other casting options, you will now see the choice to cast to an Echo Show 15 (if you have one). Amazon says more apps are adding support for Matter casting later this year, including Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, Starz, and ZDF.\n\nMatter casting is an open protocol that doesn’t require specific hardware, only that the app on your personal device and the app on the device you’re casting to have the feature enabled. It’s essentially like Apple’s AirPlay or Google’s Chromecast but available to every app or hardware maker to implement and not limited to specific phone OSes or partnerships. \n\n\"Amazon may be the only one of the big three founders of Matter to implement Matter casting\"\n\nAmazon has enabled it on its Prime Video app and says it’s working to get other platforms on board. “We’ve been developing this over a few years, and we want to put Matter casting everywhere,” Chris DeCenzo, a principal engineer at Amazon who works on Alexa devices, tells The Verge.\n\nDeCenzo says the Prime Video experience works using app-to-app communication, so you have all the same controls on your phone as you do on the app on your TV. If other hardware makers add Matter casting support to their devices, you’ll be able to cast Amazon content to supported apps on them, too.\n\n[Image: Casting options through the Prime Video app on an iPhone to a Pixel Tablet and Chromecast with Google TV device via Chromecast and to Echo Show 15 devices through Matter. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XATe1qOqzg3Fc5z2o9N_VHdqJOY=/0x0:1179x2556/1179x2556/filters:focal(590x1278:591x1279)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25213043/IMG_0013.jpeg]\n\nHowever, while Amazon is the first to adopt Matter casting, it may well be the only of the big three founders of Matter to implement it. Google and Apple already have solid, popular methods for casting content that don’t look like they’re going anywhere soon. At CES this week, Google announced its Chromecast capability will be built into all new LG TVs but made no mention of Matter casting.\n\nBut for Amazon, which has not had a proprietary way to cast content from a phone or tablet to a TV or display, Matter casting is a big deal. “Customers can begin watching a movie or browse for their next favorite show from Prime Video on their phone and cast it to their compatible Fire TV device or Echo Show 15. This is an industry-first demonstration of implementing Matter Casting,” said the company in a blog post published today.\n\nDeCenzo says that if all the big companies adopted Matter casting, it would be better for the industry, as app developers would only have to develop for one protocol — one of the founding principles of the Matter smart home standard. “We believe in open standards,” he says, “because it simplifies things for developers.” \n\nAdditionally, it would make things easier for customers. Casting from apps would work with every streaming box, TV, and smart display, and you wouldn’t have to think about what hardware you have in order to cast your content. That sounds great in theory, but — as with Matter in general — it looks like it will be a long journey to get there.\n\n---\nWhat is Matter?\n\nMatter is a new smart home interoperability standard designed to provide a common language for connected devices to communicate locally in your home without relying on a cloud connection. It is built to be secure and private, easy to set up, and widely compatible.\n\nDeveloped by Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung (and others), Matter is an open-sourced, IP-based connectivity software layer for smart home devices. It works over Wi-Fi, ethernet, and the low-power mesh networking protocol Thread and currently supports over 20 device types. These include lighting, plugs and switches, thermostats, locks, security and environment sensors, refrigerators, dishwashers, smoke alarms, air quality monitors, and more.\n\nA smart home gadget with the Matter logo can be set up and used with any Matter-compatible ecosystem via a Matter controller and controlled by them simultaneously, a feature called multi-admin. \n\nAmazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, and Apple Home are some major smart home platforms supporting Matter, along with hundreds of device manufacturers.\n---\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Twinkly’s new light curtain has the “highest LED density” in its class.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-09T14:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-01-09T14:00:00.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24029675/twinklys-new-light-curtain-has-the-highest-led-density-in-its-class","author":[],"articleBody":"The Matrix is a curtain of LEDs that you can control and program via its app, sync with music, or even have mirror a Windows screen.
