It’s the first major, venture-backed consumer tech company to hit the public markets since the end of 2021, when interest rates were still low. Other late-stage tech firms that have been delaying their listings, such as Reddit, are closely watching how public investors react to Instacart’s growth story to determine if the IPO window is truly open or not.  \n\nIt’s also a milestone for Instacart’s roughly 3,500 full-time employees, some of whom are earning generational wealth for making an early bet on a little grocery delivery startup many years ago. For those who joined Instacart in the last few years, things are more complicated.\n\nJoining a startup at the earliest stage gives someone the potential to earn the most outsized upside from the stock. In the case of Instacart, I found this analysis by Billy Gallagher at Prospect (a firm that tries to model the potential growth of private tech stocks) to be illuminating. \n\nAfter combing through historical equity award values for Instacart engineer roles from job listings and other sources, Gallagher’s conclusion is that “people who joined before 2018 saw outstanding to modest gains” in their stock, while “those who joined more recently saw a serious dip in the value of their equity between when they joined and when Instacart went public.” \n\nHis ultimate conclusion is that, after Instacart’s Series B round of funding in 2014, “employees would have earned stronger returns joining FAANG or being paid in cash and putting that money into the market.” Meanwhile, those who joined Instacart during its peak valuation of $39 billion during the pandemic are looking at a roughly 73 percent decline in the value of their stock, given that Instacart went public at a much more modest valuation of $9.9 billion. (These numbers obviously don’t account for things like stock refreshers.)\n\nNow, it’s worth noting that Instacart has made moves to try and offset the steep drop in its valuation. It gave its first companywide cash bonus last year, and its IPO was structured to offer a minimal number of shares to outside investors — a term called the “float” — to avoid diluting employee ownership as much as possible. \n\nWhat’s more, most of the cash raised from the IPO is going to pay off employee tax bills for exercising their stock. In an unusual move, employees can sell as soon as November if the stock price trades 120 percent higher than the IPO price for at least five of 10 consecutive trading days. (The typical insider lockup period is 180 days, which will apply here as well if that price isn’t achieved — it most likely won’t be.)\n\nManagement has been clear that the IPO happened so that employees, especially those who joined early, can finally sell. “We felt it was really important to give our employees liquidity,” CEO Fidji Simo, who joined as CEO from Facebook in 2021, told CNBC. “As you know, this IPO is really not about raising money for us. It’s about making sure that our employees have liquidity on the stock that they worked really hard for.” \n\nInstacart’s SEC prospectus lays out the paydays executives are seeing: ousted founder Apoorva Mehta sold stock worth about $21 million in the IPO and still retains 10 percent ownership of the company, making him the largest individual shareholder. The top three current execs — Simo, COO Asha Sharma, and CFO Nick Giovanni — were collectively awarded millions worth of restricted stock units for taking the company public. \n\nSimo’s current stock package value is about $15 million, though she stands to gain much more if the business meets certain valuation thresholds. At the highest end, if Instacart returns to a $30 billion valuation or more, she’ll get an additional 480,000 shares, which would be worth over $40 million.\n\nMoney isn’t everything in life, and I’m sure there are folks at Instacart who joined at the pandemic peak and are still happy with that decision. But if there’s any lesson to take away from the company’s IPO this week, it’s that when you join a startup, timing really matters.\n\n[Image: Larry Ellison. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b0S3UaZKKTd78Ps-K3B8ZoIgIV4=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24944409/Larry_Ellison.jpg]\n\n“This is like Sputnik”\n\nLarry Ellison rarely speaks publicly, save for Oracle’s annual conference, which was held again this week. As the fourth richest person in the world, he wields tremendous influence in politics and business. Elon Musk clearly sees him as a mentor. The two have been close for years, and Musk has modeled his setup at X / Twitter after Ellison, who de facto controls Oracle as chairman and CTO but lets CEO Safra Catz handle what he’s not interested in. Ellison invested $1 billion of his own money into Musk’s Twitter takeover, served on the board of Tesla, and his cloud service is helping power Musk’s nascent OpenAI competitor, X.ai. \n\nI’ve never watched one of Ellion’s keynotes at Oracle CloudWorld, but this year, I took the time to watch the full video. Naturally, he spends most of the more than one-hour talk effusing about generative AI. “Most cool new tech does not get the attention of heads of state and heads of government and everyday people in everyday professions,” he said at one point. “It just doesn’t. This is like Sputnik.”\n\nAfter pulling up a chair to sit down onstage rather than stand (“Now I don’t have to get down on the ground like Aaron Rodgers.” — He is 79 years old, after all!), Ellison demonstrated an impressively deep understanding of Oracle’s technology and how it relates to competitors. \n\nMuch of what he said is way too in the weeds for this writeup, but I did take note of a few interesting moments:\n\n* He off-handedly mentioned that we’ll see “complete self-driving cars” from Tesla in “in the next 12 months,” which… sure.\n* He also showed renders of the Tesla Cybertruck retrofitted as Oracle’s “next-gen police vehicle.” (Yes, I also just found out that Oracle makes software for police cars.)\n* He spent a lot of time talking about Oracle’s work in healthcare: “We’re working on a voice digital assistant for clinic purposes.” He also said the company is building a cluster of Nvidia GPUs that will be “the largest scientific computer ever built in the history of the Earth.”\n* New software projects at Oracle are being written through AI-powered coding tools, he said, rather than Java. But don’t worry, employees: there won’t be “massive layoffs.”\n* Overall, he positioned Oracle as the best cloud provider for moving data around as quickly as possible. Oracle is obviously far behind AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure in terms of market share, but Ellison seems to think that Oracle’s focus on generative AI will give the business the boost it needs. “Is it the most important new computer technology ever? Probably. One thing’s for certain: we’re about to find out.”\n\n[Image: Phil Spencer. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZcRNbLp78uHR5_9m3-79My0OaiY=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24944412/Phil_Spencer.jpg]\n\nMicrosoft’s big leak\n\nPour one out for the legal team at Microsoft this week, which accidentally uploaded a slew of highly confidential product road map details and exec emails as part of the FTC v. Microsoft case that is trying to block its acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Even Xbox chief Phil Spencer’s internal memo addressing the leaks leaked to my colleague Tom Warren. Ouch.\n\nIf you work in the gaming industry, these internal docs are a gold mine, and you’ve probably seen them already. There are details about the next Xbox, set to come out in 2028, Spencer telling colleagues his dream is to buy Nintendo one day, and much more.\n\nOne internal email that got less attention but caught my eye was this one from 2020 by CMO Takeshi Numoto expressing doubt about Microsoft buying TikTok. It’s widely known that Microsoft was pursuing a deal when the Trump administration was threatening a ban, but Numoto’s email gives an unvarnished look at how senior execs evaluate these kinds of decisions — typos and all.\n\n“Tic Tok or any other social network seem to have little in the way of hard hitting (not conceptual) adjacencies that would help us accelerate its growth (reason of us being a better owner since it will be banned otherwise, does not feel like a sound logic),” writes Numoto. “With any existing category, making real inroads into it without sufficient critical mass to begin with seem hard, and I think we all know that you can only do this when there is a macro secular shift that can be exploited (eg — shift to touch in terms of UEX (Apple and Android), or to cloud in terms of app pattern (Azure is now a much bigger infra tech provider than VMware, formerly king of infra on-prem) etc.).”\n\nGoogle’s dirty laundry\n\nAs I had hoped, the Department of Justice v. Google antitrust trial is unearthing juicy tidbits about the search giant’s business. One particularly interesting moment from the stand this week was the testimony of Google VP of ad products Jerry Dischler, who admitted that the company has increased ad prices quietly over the years to meet quarterly earnings goals.\n\nI remember hearing a similar story from a Facebook employee many years ago. Then, this source was explaining how Facebook — and really all of the huge platform companies — have a lot of wiggle room to temporarily juice user engagement and revenue. To an outsider, it may be surprising that an engineer at a company like Google can tweak some code and make a material impact on earnings, but it’s common knowledge for those inside the belly of the beast.\n\nAnother stat I caught from Dischler is that, according to his testimony, Google has roughly 5 million advertisers. I believe that’s the first time a company executive has shared that number publically, and it likely means that Meta — with its more than 10 million advertisers — has the most individual advertisers of any company on earth.  \n\nDischler also revealed that retail accounts for roughly 35 percent of search ads. About two-thirds of Google’s overall revenue comes from search ads, which is another new stat. \n\nGoogle’s lawyers are well aware that a lot of confidential information is already coming out in this trial, so I’m not surprised to see them pressure the judge to take the government’s exhibits offline. That won’t keep the ones already shared from being in the public record, though. If you’re curious, we have a handy list of exhibits that we downloaded before they were taken down.\n\nThe watercooler\n\nA roundup of what else happened in the tech industry this week that you may have missed:\n\n* Linda Yaccarino posted an ad campaign for X / Twitter that was made by employees and featured posts that were critical of Elon Musk. She then deleted and re-uploaded the video after people noticed said posts, claiming the reason for doing so was to post a higher-res version. Meanwhile, Musk quietly laid off more employees working on trust and safety.\n* After the disastrous response to Unity’s proposed pricing changes, the company is now walking them back.\n* ByteDance has chosen Seattle as the location for employees working on TikTok’s shopping push (Gee, I wonder why!) and is offering hefty relocation packages to those willing to move up there.\n* Roblox laid off about 30 recruiters due to reduced hiring targets.\n* Airtable laid off 27 percent of employees.\n* The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is building a cluster of 1,000 Nvidia GPUs for medical research.\n* Neuralink is recruiting its first human trial participants for its brain-computer chip implant. (Just don’t read about how the monkeys were treated.)\n* Google’s Waymo is gearing up to expand its robotaxi service to Los Angeles.\n\nPeople moves\n\nSome interesting career moves I noticed this week:\n\n* Panos Panay, Microsoft’s chief product officer, is reportedly going to replace Dave Limp as Amazon’s devices chief. (He doesn’t even need to move cities!)\n* Pavan Davuluri will now lead hardware at Microsoft, Mikhail Parakhin will lead a new “Windows and Web Experiences” team that still includes Bing, and Yusuf Mehdi will take over the OEM and retail business for Windows and Surface. They will all report to Rajesh Jha, the VP of “experience and devices.”\n* Alyssa Henry, the CEO of Square, suddenly stepped down and is being replaced by “Block Head” Jack Dorsey. She says she’s retiring.\n* Rob Wilk, Snap’s president of sales for the Americas, is leaving after just six months on the job. Patrick Harris, a former Meta exec who recently joined to lead partnerships, will assume the role. (What’s going on over there?)\n* Patrick Spence, the CEO of Sonos, joined Snap’s board of directors.\n* Ravi Gupta, Instacart’s former COO, joined its board.\n* Romain Huet, previously a product lead at Stripe, has joined OpenAI to lead developer relations. \n* Vinay Rao, a former Google director, is Anthropic’s new head of trust and safety.\n* David Richardson, Apple’s director of cloud engineering, is joining GM as part of the automaker’s continued raid on talent in Cupertino.\n* Joe Kreiner, VP of business development for Epic Games, says he is also retiring. (I wrote about Epic gearing up for layoffs in last week’s issue.)\n* Rajiv Ayyangar is the new CEO of Product Hunt. He previously founded the virtual office startup Tandem.\n* Eric Wittman has been named CEO of the photo-editing app VSCO, with co-founder Joel Flory moving to the role of executive chairman. \n* Sar Haribhakti has joined Stripe to lead communications for emerging products.\n\nLinkedIn update of the week\n\nYou win, Dave Clark:\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cw9ZMPRrCDdfDXGuL91_RE2pxrc=/0x0:1284x891/1284x891/filters:focal(642x446:643x447)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24944416/IMG_5765.jpeg]\n\nInteresting links\n\n* Our iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max review.\n* Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun’s prepared Senate testimony on the state of the industry.\n* Sequoia’s David Cahn examines whether “GPU capacity is getting overbuilt.”\n* Eddy Cue gives a rare interview about Apple’s sports ambitions. \n* A profile of the Airbnb leader responsible for cracking down on parties. \n* A recap of Pinterest’s first-ever Investor Day.\n* 95 percent of NFTs are now worthless.\n* TechCrunch looks at the feud between Y Combinator and a rival startup incubator, Neo.\n\nA correction\n\nIn last week’s issue, I incorrectly said that Dominic Perella was Snap’s first general counsel when, in fact, he was an early deputy general counsel.\n\n---\n\nThat’s it for this week.

It’s the first major, venture-backed consumer tech company to hit the public markets since the end of 2021, when interest rates were still low. Other late-stage tech firms that have been delaying their listings, such as Reddit, are closely watching how public investors react to Instacart’s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instacart.com%2Fcompany%2Fupdates%2Fstock-up-your-cart-a-letter-from-instacart-ceo-fidji-simo%2F">growth story</a> to determine if the IPO window is truly open or not.  </p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">It’s also a milestone for Instacart’s roughly 3,500 full-time employees, some of whom are earning generational wealth for making an early bet on a little grocery delivery startup many years ago. For those who joined Instacart in the last few years, things are more complicated.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Joining a startup at the earliest stage gives someone the potential to earn the most outsized upside from the stock.

It’s the first major, venture-backed consumer tech company to hit the public markets since the end of 2021, when interest rates were still low. Other late-stage tech firms that have been delaying their listings, such as Reddit, are closely watching how public investors react to Instacart’s growth story to determine if the IPO window is truly open or not.  \n\nIt’s also a milestone for Instacart’s roughly 3,500 full-time employees, some of whom are earning generational wealth for making an early bet on a little grocery delivery startup many years ago. For those who joined Instacart in the last few years, things are more complicated.\n\nJoining a startup at the earliest stage gives someone the potential to earn the most outsized upside from the stock. In the case of Instacart, I found this analysis by Billy Gallagher at Prospect (a firm that tries to model the potential growth of private tech stocks) to be illuminating. \n\nAfter combing through historical equity award values for Instacart engineer roles from job listings and other sources, Gallagher’s conclusion is that “people who joined before 2018 saw outstanding to modest gains” in their stock, while “those who joined more recently saw a serious dip in the value of their equity between when they joined and when Instacart went public.” \n\nHis ultimate conclusion is that, after Instacart’s Series B round of funding in 2014, “employees would have earned stronger returns joining FAANG or being paid in cash and putting that money into the market.” Meanwhile, those who joined Instacart during its peak valuation of $39 billion during the pandemic are looking at a roughly 73 percent decline in the value of their stock, given that Instacart went public at a much more modest valuation of $9.9 billion. (These numbers obviously don’t account for things like stock refreshers.)\n\nNow, it’s worth noting that Instacart has made moves to try and offset the steep drop in its valuation. It gave its first companywide cash bonus last year, and its IPO was structured to offer a minimal number of shares to outside investors — a term called the “float” — to avoid diluting employee ownership as much as possible. \n\nWhat’s more, most of the cash raised from the IPO is going to pay off employee tax bills for exercising their stock. In an unusual move, employees can sell as soon as November if the stock price trades 120 percent higher than the IPO price for at least five of 10 consecutive trading days. (The typical insider lockup period is 180 days, which will apply here as well if that price isn’t achieved — it most likely won’t be.)\n\nManagement has been clear that the IPO happened so that employees, especially those who joined early, can finally sell. “We felt it was really important to give our employees liquidity,” CEO Fidji Simo, who joined as CEO from Facebook in 2021, told CNBC. “As you know, this IPO is really not about raising money for us. It’s about making sure that our employees have liquidity on the stock that they worked really hard for.” \n\nInstacart’s SEC prospectus lays out the paydays executives are seeing: ousted founder Apoorva Mehta sold stock worth about $21 million in the IPO and still retains 10 percent ownership of the company, making him the largest individual shareholder.

As the fourth richest person in the world, he wields tremendous influence in politics and business. Elon Musk clearly sees him as a mentor. The two have been close for years, and Musk has modeled his setup at X / Twitter after Ellison, who de facto controls Oracle as chairman and CTO but lets CEO Safra Catz handle what he’s not interested in. Ellison invested $1 billion of his own money into Musk’s Twitter takeover, served on the board of Tesla, and his cloud service is helping power Musk’s nascent OpenAI competitor, X.ai. \n\nI’ve never watched one of Ellion’s keynotes at Oracle CloudWorld, but this year, I took the time to watch the full video. Naturally, he spends most of the more than one-hour talk effusing about generative AI. “Most cool new tech does not get the attention of heads of state and heads of government and everyday people in everyday professions,” he said at one point. “It just doesn’t. This is like Sputnik.”\n\nAfter pulling up a chair to sit down onstage rather than stand (“Now I don’t have to get down on the ground like Aaron Rodgers.” — He is 79 years old, after all!), Ellison demonstrated an impressively deep understanding of Oracle’s technology and how it relates to competitors. \n\nMuch of what he said is way too in the weeds for this writeup, but I did take note of a few interesting moments:\n\n* He off-handedly mentioned that we’ll see “complete self-driving cars” from Tesla in “in the next 12 months,” which… sure.\n* He also showed renders of the Tesla Cybertruck retrofitted as Oracle’s “next-gen police vehicle.” (Yes, I also just found out that Oracle makes software for police cars.)\n* He spent a lot of time talking about Oracle’s work in healthcare: “We’re working on a voice digital assistant for clinic purposes.” He also said the company is building a cluster of Nvidia GPUs that will be “the largest scientific computer ever built in the history of the Earth.”\n* New software projects at Oracle are being written through AI-powered coding tools, he said, rather than Java. But don’t worry, employees: there won’t be “massive layoffs.”\n* Overall, he positioned Oracle as the best cloud provider for moving data around as quickly as possible. Oracle is obviously far behind AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure in terms of market share, but Ellison seems to think that Oracle’s focus on generative AI will give the business the boost it needs. “Is it the most important new computer technology ever? Probably. One thing’s for certain: we’re about to find out.”\n\n[Image: Phil Spencer. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZcRNbLp78uHR5_9m3-79My0OaiY=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24944412/Phil_Spencer.jpg]\n\nMicrosoft’s big leak\n\nPour one out for the legal team at Microsoft this week, which accidentally uploaded a slew of highly confidential product road map details and exec emails as part of the FTC v. Microsoft case that is trying to block its acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Even Xbox chief Phil Spencer’s internal memo addressing the leaks leaked to my colleague Tom Warren. Ouch.\n\nIf you work in the gaming industry, these internal docs are a gold mine, and you’ve probably seen them already. There are details about the next Xbox, set to come out in 2028, Spencer telling colleagues his dream is to buy Nintendo one day, and much more.\n\nOne internal email that got less attention but caught my eye was this one from 2020 by CMO Takeshi Numoto expressing doubt about Microsoft buying TikTok. It’s widely known that Microsoft was pursuing a deal when the Trump administration was threatening a ban, but Numoto’s email gives an unvarnished look at how senior execs evaluate these kinds of decisions — typos and all.\n\n“Tic Tok or any other social network seem to have little in the way of hard hitting (not conceptual) adjacencies that would help us accelerate its growth (reason of us being a better owner since it will be banned otherwise, does not feel like a sound logic),” writes Numoto. “With any existing category, making real inroads into it without sufficient critical mass to begin with seem hard, and I think we all know that you can only do this when there is a macro secular shift that can be exploited (eg — shift to touch in terms of UEX (Apple and Android), or to cloud in terms of app pattern (Azure is now a much bigger infra tech provider than VMware, formerly king of infra on-prem) etc.).”\n\nGoogle’s dirty laundry\n\nAs I had hoped, the Department of Justice v. Google antitrust trial is unearthing juicy tidbits about the search giant’s business. One particularly interesting moment from the stand this week was the testimony of Google VP of ad products Jerry Dischler, who admitted that the company has increased ad prices quietly over the years to meet quarterly earnings goals.\n\nI remember hearing a similar story from a Facebook employee many years ago. Then, this source was explaining how Facebook — and really all of the huge platform companies — have a lot of wiggle room to temporarily juice user engagement and revenue. To an outsider, it may be surprising that an engineer at a company like Google can tweak some code and make a material impact on earnings, but it’s common knowledge for those inside the belly of the beast.\n\nAnother stat I caught from Dischler is that, according to his testimony, Google has roughly 5 million advertisers. I believe that’s the first time a company executive has shared that number publically, and it likely means that Meta — with its more than 10 million advertisers — has the most individual advertisers of any company on earth.  \n\nDischler also revealed that retail accounts for roughly 35 percent of search ads. About two-thirds of Google’s overall revenue comes from search ads, which is another new stat. \n\nGoogle’s lawyers are well aware that a lot of confidential information is already coming out in this trial, so I’m not surprised to see them pressure the judge to take the government’s exhibits offline. That won’t keep the ones already shared from being in the public record, though. If you’re curious, we have a handy list of exhibits that we downloaded before they were taken down.\n\nThe watercooler\n\nA roundup of what else happened in the tech industry this week that you may have missed:\n\n* Linda Yaccarino posted an ad campaign for X / Twitter that was made by employees and featured posts that were critical of Elon Musk.

It’s the first major, venture-backed consumer tech company to hit the public markets since the end of 2021, when interest rates were still low. Other late-stage tech firms that have been delaying their listings, such as Reddit, are closely watching how public investors react to Instacart’s growth story to determine if the IPO window is truly open or not.  \n\nIt’s also a milestone for Instacart’s roughly 3,500 full-time employees, some of whom are earning generational wealth for making an early bet on a little grocery delivery startup many years ago. For those who joined Instacart in the last few years, things are more complicated.\n\nJoining a startup at the earliest stage gives someone the potential to earn the most outsized upside from the stock. In the case of Instacart, I found this analysis by Billy Gallagher at Prospect (a firm that tries to model the potential growth of private tech stocks) to be illuminating. \n\nAfter combing through historical equity award values for Instacart engineer roles from job listings and other sources, Gallagher’s conclusion is that “people who joined before 2018 saw outstanding to modest gains” in their stock, while “those who joined more recently saw a serious dip in the value of their equity between when they joined and when Instacart went public.” \n\nHis ultimate conclusion is that, after Instacart’s Series B round of funding in 2014, “employees would have earned stronger returns joining FAANG or being paid in cash and putting that money into the market.” Meanwhile, those who joined Instacart during its peak valuation of $39 billion during the pandemic are looking at a roughly 73 percent decline in the value of their stock, given that Instacart went public at a much more modest valuation of $9.9 billion. (These numbers obviously don’t account for things like stock refreshers.)\n\nNow, it’s worth noting that Instacart has made moves to try and offset the steep drop in its valuation. It gave its first companywide cash bonus last year, and its IPO was structured to offer a minimal number of shares to outside investors — a term called the “float” — to avoid diluting employee ownership as much as possible. \n\nWhat’s more, most of the cash raised from the IPO is going to pay off employee tax bills for exercising their stock. In an unusual move, employees can sell as soon as November if the stock price trades 120 percent higher than the IPO price for at least five of 10 consecutive trading days. (The typical insider lockup period is 180 days, which will apply here as well if that price isn’t achieved — it most likely won’t be.)\n\nManagement has been clear that the IPO happened so that employees, especially those who joined early, can finally sell. “We felt it was really important to give our employees liquidity,” CEO Fidji Simo, who joined as CEO from Facebook in 2021, told CNBC. “As you know, this IPO is really not about raising money for us. It’s about making sure that our employees have liquidity on the stock that they worked really hard for.” \n\nInstacart’s SEC prospectus lays out the paydays executives are seeing: ousted founder Apoorva Mehta sold stock worth about $21 million in the IPO and still retains 10 percent ownership of the company, making him the largest individual shareholder. The top three current execs — Simo, COO Asha Sharma, and CFO Nick Giovanni — were collectively awarded millions worth of restricted stock units for taking the company public. \n\nSimo’s current stock package value is about $15 million, though she stands to gain much more if the business meets certain valuation thresholds. At the highest end, if Instacart returns to a $30 billion valuation or more, she’ll get an additional 480,000 shares, which would be worth over $40 million.\n\nMoney isn’t everything in life, and I’m sure there are folks at Instacart who joined at the pandemic peak and are still happy with that decision.
