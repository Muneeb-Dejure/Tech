Vox’s Peter Kafka, who has been going to the conference since it started in 2008, called it “the weirdest session I’ve ever seen.” If I had to sum up the vibe as everyone trickled off to dinner afterward, it would be stunned disbelief. As for Yaccarino, she immediately fled the premises with her six-person security detail.\n\nGiven how her first interview on the job with CNBC went about a month ago, I had low expectations for her ability to field questions from the tough-as-nails Julia Boorstin on the Code stage. But nothing could have prepared me for how woefully unequipped she was to hold her own. There was something poetic about the Financial Times dropping a profile of her that same day with a photo in a literal crucifix pose.\n\nIf you know anything about how Yaccarino came to what is now known as X, it’s clear that she has been set up to fail. She practically begged Musk to hire her, who ended up agreeing to give her the “CEO” vanity title despite him continuing to essentially run the company. She’s invisible to the engineers and handful of product people still working at X, who report to Musk and not her. \n\nOnstage at Code yesterday, Yaccarino was physically flustered by the surprise earlier appearance that day of Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety who was fired by Musk and forced to flee his home after Musk suggested that he was a pedophile. Despite Boorstin giving her ample opportunity to address Roth at the beginning of their talk and move on, Yaccarino kept revisiting what had unfolded before her, like a criminal returning to the scene of the crime.\n\nThroughout the conversation, she repeatedly dodged specific questions about the state of X’s business, at times revealing that she may not actually know the answers. X now has “something like” 200 to 250 million daily active users, she said at one point. She clearly didn’t know the status of Musk’s plan to enforce a stricter paywall and said it’s looking like X will turn a profit sometime early next year. \n\nShe bragged that X was hiring again, failing to mention that one of the few people just hired is apparently her son. One of my favorite moments was when she, for some reason, held up her iPhone homescreen to the crowd to reveal that the X app was nowhere to be found. Facebook and Instagram, however, were visible, along with the Holy Bible — the original super app. (This homescreen slip-up has gotten attention on the Blind channel for X employees, too.)\n\nI’m not sure if Yaccarino and Musk were already on thin ice going into her interview this week, but it’s hard to see how they won’t be now. Her mix of combativeness and Trump-like diversion of the real questions revealed, to me, deep insecurity about her job and how she is perceived. If Musk really wants her to be CEO, he should start treating her like one. Otherwise, it’s not going to work out for either of them.\n\n---\n\n[Image: Mark Zuckerberg. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bh5rYdlom6CQNyGQDI5uTezYif0=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24963167/Mark_Zuckerberg_Interview.jpg]\n\n1:1 with Zuck\n\nLast week, I flew up to San Francisco to interview Mark Zuckerberg at Meta’s headquarters in Menlo Park. These conversations have become somewhat of an annual tradition for us, timed to the company’s Connect conference. In a world where the biggest tech CEOs are increasingly shunning the media, I’ve appreciated Mark’s willingness to engage and let me ask whatever I want.\n\nFresh off an MMA training session that morning, he covered a lot of ground with me for over an hour. You can watch the full conversation, which we published yesterday, on YouTube, listen to it in the Decoder feed, or read the transcript. I went deeper into the AI news Meta announced this week in a separate story on The Verge, featuring an interview with Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta’s VP of generative AI. (I’ll have more thoughts on the implications of Meta’s AI assistant and characters later.)\n\nThanks to all of you who have already reached out about enjoying the Zuckerberg interview. Some of what he said about Elon Musk and Twitter has made headlines. (He also had a conversation with Lex Fridman this week using Meta’s ultra-realistic, high-res virtual avatars, which I got to try last year during a trip to the company’s R&D office in Redmond.) \n\nHere are some things Zuckerberg said that stood out in our interview:\n\n* He has been thinking about decentralized social media for a while and is open to bringing other apps besides Threads to open protocols like ActivityPub. “My view is that the more that there’s interoperability between different services and the more content can flow, the better all the services can be. And I guess I’m just confident enough that we can build the best one of the services, that I actually think that we’ll benefit and we’ll be able to build better quality products by making sure that we can have access to all of the different content from wherever anyone is creating it.”\n* Meta is starting to work on interoperability with messaging apps it doesn’t own. I had yet to hear anyone at the company publicly acknowledge this until Zuckerberg mentioned it. “The plan was always to start with interop between our services, but then get to that. We’re starting to experiment with that, too.” (That may be the case, but I’d be remiss not to note that Meta has to do this as part of new regulation in the EU that goes into effect next year.)\n* It sounds like the US government isn’t close to regulating AI. Zuckerberg attended the recent Senate hearing on AI with a bunch of other tech CEOs: “There’s sort of the meme that it’s like, ‘Okay, a lot of these politicians, they go to a place where they’ll get attention for themselves.’ But, you know, this was a three-hour event, and I think there were like 40 senators sitting and listening and taking notes and not really participating in the discussion but just there to learn.” \n* He sees open-sourcing Meta’s AI technology as a strategic advantage. “We believe that it’s generally positive to open-source a lot of our infrastructure for a few reasons. One is that we don’t have a cloud business, right? So it’s not like we’re selling access to the infrastructure, so giving it away is fine. And then, when we do give it away, we generally benefit from innovation from the ecosystem, and when other people adopt the stuff, it increases volume and drives down prices.”\n* He is very aware of the closed-model AI companies shit-talking his open-source approach behind his back. “I hear either overtly or sometimes behind closed doors, something will get back to me that’s like, ‘Oh, this company was talking about why they’re kind of against open source.’ And it’s like, yeah, well, their whole business depends on selling access to proprietary models, so I think you have to be careful about that.”\n* Meta is working on the next version of Llama and hasn’t decided whether to open-source it or not. “We’re training the next version of Llama now, and I think we’ll probably have the same set of debates around that and how we should release it. And again, I sort of, like, lean toward wanting to do it open source, but I think we need to do all the red teaming and understand the risks before making a call.”\n* Stay tuned for an “AI Studio” product sometime next year that lets creators and businesses make their own bespoke AIs. “That will make it so that anyone can build their own AIs, sort of just like you create your own UGC, your own content across social networks.”\n* AI is going to supercharge Meta’s new smart glasses soon. “This isn’t in the first software release, but sometime early next year, we’re also going to have this multimodality. So you’re gonna be able to ask the AI, ‘Hey, what is it that I’m looking at? What type of plant is that? Where am I? How expensive is this thing?’ So now I think we’re at this point where it may actually be the case that for smart glasses, the AI is compelling before the holograms and the displays are.”\n* He thinks last year’s Quest Pro headset was too expensive. (I think it had other problems, Mark!) “And what we’ve seen so far is that at least consumers are very cost-conscious. We expected to sell way fewer Quest Pros than Quest 2s, and that [bore] out. It’s always hard to predict exactly what it’ll be when you’re shipping a product at $1,500 for the first time, but it was kind of fine. Within expectations — it wasn’t like a grand slam, but it did fine.”\n* Social experiences have overtaken gaming on the Quest in terms of time spent. This sounds like a very recent change, likely aided by Roblox coming to the platform.\n* Meta is having difficulty bringing down the cost of its full-fledged AR glasses, which represent the biggest portion of the Reality Labs budget. “It’s this fundamentally kind of counterintuitive thing where I think humans get super impressed by building big things, like the pyramids. I think a lot of time, building small things, like cures for diseases at a cellular level or miniaturizing a supercomputer to fit into your glasses, are maybe even bigger feats than building some really physically large things, but it seems less impressive for some reason.”\n\n---\n\n[Image: Evan Spiegel. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-vH0JURsZguZekbfYl9MFnhzso=/0x0:501x501/501x501/filters:focal(251x251:252x252)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24722493/Command_Line_Evan_Spiegel.jpg]\n\nSnap’s cuts\n\nOn Tuesday evening, I broke the news that Snap was about to lay off roughly 150 employees in its AR division. The next morning, the company announced that it’s axing the enterprise AR shopping group that was just unveiled in April. The idea was to sell Snap’s AR software to retailers like Nike so that their customers could virtually try on clothes and shoes.\n\n“After exploring our options over the past few months, it became clear that it would take significant incremental investment to grow our enterprise offering for retailers and we simply cannot make that investment at this time,” CEO Evan Spiegel told employees in an internal memo announcing the cuts, which I’ve heard were decided after a detailed review of the company’s AR strategy by upper management. Jill Popelka, a former exec at the enterprise giant SAP who joined less than two years ago to lead the division (and spoke onstage at Snap’s splashy developer conference earlier this year), is out.\n\nGiven Snap’s financial position, Spiegel is right to cut back on projects that aren’t core to the business. But it’s impossible not to see these layoffs as anything other than an unforced error. “Really a shame to see another 150 people let go after 6 months because of poor leadership from the top,” Evan Orenstein, an early Snap employee, wrote on X. “Where does the buck stop?\n\nSnap’s stock-based compensation is still through the roof, and given how its stock price has barely budged this week, I have a feeling that these cuts may not be the last.\n\n---\n\n[Image: Tim Sweeney. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAIpKPxsU3gWo9sl5LKRYI9kny4=/0x0:501x501/501x501/filters:focal(251x251:252x252)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24698906/Command_Line_Tim_Sweeney.jpeg]\n\nBad news at Epic Games\n\nIn a recent issue of this newsletter, I said that Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, was preparing for a significant round of layoffs. Yesterday, they were announced by CEO Tim Sweeney. Sixteen percent of employees, or about 830 people, are being laid off, along with roughly 250 leaving through the divesting of Bandcamp and SuperAwesome, two companies Epic acquired during the pandemic.\n\n“For a while now, we’ve been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators,” Sweeney said in his note to employees. “I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic.” \n\nHe framed the cuts as a refocusing on the core business and noted that Fortnite’s push to share more revenue with creators and compete with Roblox has driven down margins. Laid-off employees will get accelerated stock vesting through 2024 and will be given two more years to exercise. Epic is unusual for such a large, late-stage private company in that it doesn’t issue RSUs but rather options to employees, which can be expensive to exercise. Whether employees can get liquidity soon after exercising is another issue entirely that Epic has yet to address.\n\nAs I reported before, Epic held talks to raise more money this year but recently put a round on hold. I could see these cuts as a prerequisite to raising down the line on more favorable terms, though the company isn’t saying anything about that right now.\n\n---\n\nThe watercooler\n\nA roundup of what else happened in the tech industry this week that you may have missed:\n\n* Sam Altman, Jony Ive, and Masayoshi Son are talking about raising as much as $1 billion to build an AI-powered phone. (HBO needs to make a new season of Silicon Valley ASAP.)\n* Amazon is tracking individual employee office attendance and sharing “badge reports” with them.\n* Nvidia’s office in France was raided by the local competition authority, which is investigating anti-competitive behavior in the GPU industry. \n* In a major coup against Google Cloud, Amazon is leading a $4 billion funding round in Anthropic (it sounds like mostly cloud credits).\n* Fresh off being copied by Meta, Character.AI is in talks to raise more money at a valuation of at least $5 billion.\n* OpenAI is in talks to let employees cash out in a new funding round that could value the business north of $80 billion.\n* Senior ByteDance leaders are increasingly taking leading roles at TikTok, blurring the line between the two entities.\n* Apple’s work on a car appears to have significantly stalled.\n* Microsoft discussed selling Bing to Apple in 2020, but Apple stuck with Google (billions in essentially free money is hard to walk away from).\n* Arc, an electric boat startup that has been getting a lot of buzz in VC circles, announced a $70 million Series B round of funding.\n* Carta is suing former CPO Heidi Johnson for secretly recording conversations with other execs (things sound very dramatic over there).\n* Apple is telling its retail employees to call its horribly bad FineWoven iPhone case a “luxurious microtwill.” (Time to bring back “you’re holding it wrong”?)\n\n---\n\nPeople moves\n\nSome interesting career moves I noticed this week:\n\n* Panos Panay, Microsoft’s former chief product officer, is officially Amazon’s new head of devices and services, replacing David Limp, who has gone to run Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. (An interesting way to “retire”!)\n* Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah is Uber’s new CFO. He previously held the same position at Analog Devices.\n* Tom Cortese, Peloton’s co-founder and CPO, is leaving and will be replaced by former Twitter exec Nick Caldwell.\n* Alexis Black Bjorlin, Meta’s VP of AI infrastructure who was leading work on a custom chip, is leaving and will be replaced by Yee Jiun Song.\n* Cory Steuben joined Lucid Motors as director of midsize vehicles.\n* Peggy Johnson, the CEO of troubled AR startup Magic Leap, joined Fox’s board of directors.\n* Luther Lowe, Yelp’s head of policy and Google Public Enemy No. 1, is leaving after over 15 years in the job.\n* I’m hearing that a general manager search is underway at Yuga Labs. The idea is to hire a big-name exec to move beyond the startup’s Web3 focus…\n\n---\n\nInteresting links\n\n* Our roundup of all the news and interesting moments that came out of the Code Conference this week.\n* AMD CEO Lisa Su’s full interview at Code.\n* The FTC’s long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.\n* When does Garry Tan run for San Francisco mayor?\n\n---\n\nThat’s it for this issue. I’ll be back next week. In the meantime, I’d love to hear your feedback, story ideas, and whether you also keep Settings in your iPhone dock.\n\nThanks for subscribing.\n"}</script><link rel="preload" as="image"

disastrous performance of X / Twitter CEO <strong>Linda Yaccarino</strong></a>, who closed out the two-day affair in spectacular fashion. <em>Vox’s </em><strong>Peter Kafka</strong>, who has been going to the conference since it started in 2008, <a href="https://link.vox.com/view/629692b4e096882bab0a61e5jkemw.569/5e3481c5">called it</a> “the weirdest session I’ve ever seen.” If I had to sum up the vibe as everyone trickled off to dinner afterward, it would be stunned disbelief. As for Yaccarino, she immediately fled the premises with her six-person security detail.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">Given how her first interview on the job <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/08/10/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-x-corp-ceo-linda-yaccarino-on-twitter-rebrand-and-more.html">with CNBC<em> </em>went<em> </em>about a month ago</a>, I had low expectations for her ability to field questions from the tough-as-nails <strong>Julia Boorstin</strong> on the Code stage. But nothing could have prepared me for how woefully unequipped she was to hold her own. There was something poetic about the <em>Financial Times </em>dropping a profile of her that same day with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/18508c6f-c5f7-4e40-ad6f-ad46476d17bf">a photo in a literal crucifix pose</a>.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph mb-20 font-fkroman text-18 leading-160 -tracking-1 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">If you know anything about how Yaccarino came to what is now known as X, it’s clear that she has been set up to fail. She practically begged Musk to hire her, who ended up agreeing to give her the “CEO” vanity title despite him continuing to essentially run the company. She’s invisible to the engineers and handful of product people still working at X, who report to Musk and not her. </p></div></div><div style="position:fixed;top:1px;left:1px;width:1px;height:0;padding:0;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border-width:0;display:none"></div><div class="relative z-[2] ml-[-20px] w-[100vw] md:left-[calc(-50vw+42%)] md:ml-0 lg:left-[calc(-50vw+75%)]"><div class="absolute top-[-200px] h-[200px] w-[100%] bg-paywall-fade"></div><div class="bg-white p-18"><div class="mx-auto my-20 border-t-2 border-t-blurple pt-18 lg:max-w-[1100px]"><h3 class="mb-14 font-polysans text-35 font-bold leading-100">Start your Command Line free trial now to continue reading</h3><p class="mb-18 font-fkroman text-18">This story is exclusively for subscribers of <em>Command Line</em>, our newsletter about the tech industry’s inside conversation.

Vox’s Peter Kafka, who has been going to the conference since it started in 2008, called it “the weirdest session I’ve ever seen.” If I had to sum up the vibe as everyone trickled off to dinner afterward, it would be stunned disbelief. As for Yaccarino, she immediately fled the premises with her six-person security detail.\n\nGiven how her first interview on the job with CNBC went about a month ago, I had low expectations for her ability to field questions from the tough-as-nails Julia Boorstin on the Code stage. But nothing could have prepared me for how woefully unequipped she was to hold her own. There was something poetic about the Financial Times dropping a profile of her that same day with a photo in a literal crucifix pose.\n\nIf you know anything about how Yaccarino came to what is now known as X, it’s clear that she has been set up to fail. She practically begged Musk to hire her, who ended up agreeing to give her the “CEO” vanity title despite him continuing to essentially run the company. She’s invisible to the engineers and handful of product people still working at X, who report to Musk and not her. \n\nOnstage at Code yesterday, Yaccarino was physically flustered by the surprise earlier appearance that day of Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety who was fired by Musk and forced to flee his home after Musk suggested that he was a pedophile. Despite Boorstin giving her ample opportunity to address Roth at the beginning of their talk and move on, Yaccarino kept revisiting what had unfolded before her, like a criminal returning to the scene of the crime.\n\nThroughout the conversation, she repeatedly dodged specific questions about the state of X’s business, at times revealing that she may not actually know the answers. X now has “something like” 200 to 250 million daily active users, she said at one point. She clearly didn’t know the status of Musk’s plan to enforce a stricter paywall and said it’s looking like X will turn a profit sometime early next year. \n\nShe bragged that X was hiring again, failing to mention that one of the few people just hired is apparently her son. One of my favorite moments was when she, for some reason, held up her iPhone homescreen to the crowd to reveal that the X app was nowhere to be found. Facebook and Instagram, however, were visible, along with the Holy Bible — the original super app. (This homescreen slip-up has gotten attention on the Blind channel for X employees, too.)\n\nI’m not sure if Yaccarino and Musk were already on thin ice going into her interview this week, but it’s hard to see how they won’t be now. Her mix of combativeness and Trump-like diversion of the real questions revealed, to me, deep insecurity about her job and how she is perceived. If Musk really wants her to be CEO, he should start treating her like one. Otherwise, it’s not going to work out for either of them.\n\n---\n\n[Image: Mark Zuckerberg. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bh5rYdlom6CQNyGQDI5uTezYif0=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24963167/Mark_Zuckerberg_Interview.jpg]\n\n1:1 with Zuck\n\nLast week, I flew up to San Francisco to interview Mark Zuckerberg at Meta’s headquarters in Menlo Park. These conversations have become somewhat of an annual tradition for us, timed to the company’s Connect conference. In a world where the biggest tech CEOs are increasingly shunning the media, I’ve appreciated Mark’s willingness to engage and let me ask whatever I want.\n\nFresh off an MMA training session that morning, he covered a lot of ground with me for over an hour. You can watch the full conversation, which we published yesterday, on YouTube, listen to it in the Decoder feed, or read the transcript. I went deeper into the AI news Meta announced this week in a separate story on The Verge, featuring an interview with Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta’s VP of generative AI. (I’ll have more thoughts on the implications of Meta’s AI assistant and characters later.)\n\nThanks to all of you who have already reached out about enjoying the Zuckerberg interview. Some of what he said about Elon Musk and Twitter has made headlines. (He also had a conversation with Lex Fridman this week using Meta’s ultra-realistic, high-res virtual avatars, which I got to try last year during a trip to the company’s R\u0026D office in Redmond.) \n\nHere are some things Zuckerberg said that stood out in our interview:\n\n* He has been thinking about decentralized social media for a while and is open to bringing other apps besides Threads to open protocols like ActivityPub. “My view is that the more that there’s interoperability between different services and the more content can flow, the better all the services can be. And I guess I’m just confident enough that we can build the best one of the services, that I actually think that we’ll benefit and we’ll be able to build better quality products by making sure that we can have access to all of the different content from wherever anyone is creating it.”\n* Meta is starting to work on interoperability with messaging apps it doesn’t own. I had yet to hear anyone at the company publicly acknowledge this until Zuckerberg mentioned it. “The plan was always to start with interop between our services, but then get to that. We’re starting to experiment with that, too.” (That may be the case, but I’d be remiss not to note that Meta has to do this as part of new regulation in the EU that goes into effect next year.)\n* It sounds like the US government isn’t close to regulating AI. Zuckerberg attended the recent Senate hearing on AI with a bunch of other tech CEOs: “There’s sort of the meme that it’s like, ‘Okay, a lot of these politicians, they go to a place where they’ll get attention for themselves.’ But, you know, this was a three-hour event, and I think there were like 40 senators sitting and listening and taking notes and not really participating in the discussion but just there to learn.” \n* He sees open-sourcing Meta’s AI technology as a strategic advantage. “We believe that it’s generally positive to open-source a lot of our infrastructure for a few reasons. One is that we don’t have a cloud business, right? So it’s not like we’re selling access to the infrastructure, so giving it away is fine. And then, when we do give it away, we generally benefit from innovation from the ecosystem, and when other people adopt the stuff, it increases volume and drives down prices.”\n* He is very aware of the closed-model AI companies shit-talking his open-source approach behind his back. “I hear either overtly or sometimes behind closed doors, something will get back to me that’s like, ‘Oh, this company was talking about why they’re kind of against open source.’ And it’s like, yeah, well, their whole business depends on selling access to proprietary models, so I think you have to be careful about that.”\n* Meta is working on the next version of Llama and hasn’t decided whether to open-source it or not. “We’re training the next version of Llama now, and I think we’ll probably have the same set of debates around that and how we should release it. And again, I sort of, like, lean toward wanting to do it open source, but I think we need to do all the red teaming and understand the risks before making a call.”\n* Stay tuned for an “AI Studio” product sometime next year that lets creators and businesses make their own bespoke AIs. “That will make it so that anyone can build their own AIs, sort of just like you create your own UGC, your own content across social networks.”\n* AI is going to supercharge Meta’s new smart glasses soon. “This isn’t in the first software release, but sometime early next year, we’re also going to have this multimodality. So you’re gonna be able to ask the AI, ‘Hey, what is it that I’m looking at? What type of plant is that? Where am I? How expensive is this thing?’ So now I think we’re at this point where it may actually be the case that for smart glasses, the AI is compelling before the holograms and the displays are.”\n* He thinks last year’s Quest Pro headset was too expensive. (I think it had other problems, Mark!) “And what we’ve seen so far is that at least consumers are very cost-conscious. We expected to sell way fewer Quest Pros than Quest 2s, and that [bore] out. It’s always hard to predict exactly what it’ll be when you’re shipping a product at $1,500 for the first time, but it was kind of fine. Within expectations — it wasn’t like a grand slam, but it did fine.”\n* Social experiences have overtaken gaming on the Quest in terms of time spent. This sounds like a very recent change, likely aided by Roblox coming to the platform.\n* Meta is having difficulty bringing down the cost of its full-fledged AR glasses, which represent the biggest portion of the Reality Labs budget. “It’s this fundamentally kind of counterintuitive thing where I think humans get super impressed by building big things, like the pyramids. I think a lot of time, building small things, like cures for diseases at a cellular level or miniaturizing a supercomputer to fit into your glasses, are maybe even bigger feats than building some really physically large things, but it seems less impressive for some reason.”\n\n---\n\n[Image: Evan Spiegel. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-vH0JURsZguZekbfYl9MFnhzso=/0x0:501x501/501x501/filters:focal(251x251:252x252)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24722493/Command_Line_Evan_Spiegel.jpg]\n\nSnap’s cuts\n\nOn Tuesday evening, I broke the news that Snap was about to lay off roughly 150 employees in its AR division. The next morning, the company announced that it’s axing the enterprise AR shopping group that was just unveiled in April. The idea was to sell Snap’s AR software to retailers like Nike so that their customers could virtually try on clothes and shoes.\n\n“After exploring our options over the past few months, it became clear that it would take significant incremental investment to grow our enterprise offering for retailers and we simply cannot make that investment at this time,” CEO Evan Spiegel told employees in an internal memo announcing the cuts, which I’ve heard were decided after a detailed review of the company’s AR strategy by upper management. Jill Popelka, a former exec at the enterprise giant SAP who joined less than two years ago to lead the division (and spoke onstage at Snap’s splashy developer conference earlier this year), is out.\n\nGiven Snap’s financial position, Spiegel is right to cut back on projects that aren’t core to the business. But it’s impossible not to see these layoffs as anything other than an unforced error. “Really a shame to see another 150 people let go after 6 months because of poor leadership from the top,” Evan Orenstein, an early Snap employee, wrote on X. “Where does the buck stop?\n\nSnap’s stock-based compensation is still through the roof, and given how its stock price has barely budged this week, I have a feeling that these cuts may not be the last.\n\n---\n\n[Image: Tim Sweeney. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAIpKPxsU3gWo9sl5LKRYI9kny4=/0x0:501x501/501x501/filters:focal(251x251:252x252)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24698906/Command_Line_Tim_Sweeney.jpeg]\n\nBad news at Epic Games\n\nIn a recent issue of this newsletter, I said that Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, was preparing for a significant round of layoffs. Yesterday, they were announced by CEO Tim Sweeney. Sixteen percent of employees, or about 830 people, are being laid off, along with roughly 250 leaving through the divesting of Bandcamp and SuperAwesome, two companies Epic acquired during the pandemic.\n\n“For a while now, we’ve been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators,” Sweeney said in his note to employees. “I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic.” \n\nHe framed the cuts as a refocusing on the core business and noted that Fortnite’s push to share more revenue with creators and compete with Roblox has driven down margins. Laid-off employees will get accelerated stock vesting through 2024 and will be given two more years to exercise. Epic is unusual for such a large, late-stage private company in that it doesn’t issue RSUs but rather options to employees, which can be expensive to exercise.

Vox’s Peter Kafka, who has been going to the conference since it started in 2008, called it “the weirdest session I’ve ever seen.” If I had to sum up the vibe as everyone trickled off to dinner afterward, it would be stunned disbelief. As for Yaccarino, she immediately fled the premises with her six-person security detail.\n\nGiven how her first interview on the job with CNBC went about a month ago, I had low expectations for her ability to field questions from the tough-as-nails Julia Boorstin on the Code stage. But nothing could have prepared me for how woefully unequipped she was to hold her own. There was something poetic about the Financial Times dropping a profile of her that same day with a photo in a literal crucifix pose.\n\nIf you know anything about how Yaccarino came to what is now known as X, it’s clear that she has been set up to fail. She practically begged Musk to hire her, who ended up agreeing to give her the “CEO” vanity title despite him continuing to essentially run the company. She’s invisible to the engineers and handful of product people still working at X, who report to Musk and not her. \n\nOnstage at Code yesterday, Yaccarino was physically flustered by the surprise earlier appearance that day of Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety who was fired by Musk and forced to flee his home after Musk suggested that he was a pedophile. Despite Boorstin giving her ample opportunity to address Roth at the beginning of their talk and move on, Yaccarino kept revisiting what had unfolded before her, like a criminal returning to the scene of the crime.\n\nThroughout the conversation, she repeatedly dodged specific questions about the state of X’s business, at times revealing that she may not actually know the answers. X now has “something like” 200 to 250 million daily active users, she said at one point. She clearly didn’t know the status of Musk’s plan to enforce a stricter paywall and said it’s looking like X will turn a profit sometime early next year. \n\nShe bragged that X was hiring again, failing to mention that one of the few people just hired is apparently her son. One of my favorite moments was when she, for some reason, held up her iPhone homescreen to the crowd to reveal that the X app was nowhere to be found. Facebook and Instagram, however, were visible, along with the Holy Bible — the original super app. (This homescreen slip-up has gotten attention on the Blind channel for X employees, too.)\n\nI’m not sure if Yaccarino and Musk were already on thin ice going into her interview this week, but it’s hard to see how they won’t be now. Her mix of combativeness and Trump-like diversion of the real questions revealed, to me, deep insecurity about her job and how she is perceived. If Musk really wants her to be CEO, he should start treating her like one. Otherwise, it’s not going to work out for either of them.\n\n---\n\n[Image: Mark Zuckerberg. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bh5rYdlom6CQNyGQDI5uTezYif0=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24963167/Mark_Zuckerberg_Interview.jpg]\n\n1:1 with Zuck\n\nLast week, I flew up to San Francisco to interview Mark Zuckerberg at Meta’s headquarters in Menlo Park. These conversations have become somewhat of an annual tradition for us, timed to the company’s Connect conference. In a world where the biggest tech CEOs are increasingly shunning the media, I’ve appreciated Mark’s willingness to engage and let me ask whatever I want.\n\nFresh off an MMA training session that morning, he covered a lot of ground with me for over an hour. You can watch the full conversation, which we published yesterday, on YouTube, listen to it in the Decoder feed, or read the transcript. I went deeper into the AI news Meta announced this week in a separate story on The Verge, featuring an interview with Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta’s VP of generative AI. (I’ll have more thoughts on the implications of Meta’s AI assistant and characters later.)\n\nThanks to all of you who have already reached out about enjoying the Zuckerberg interview. Some of what he said about Elon Musk and Twitter has made headlines. (He also had a conversation with Lex Fridman this week using Meta’s ultra-realistic, high-res virtual avatars, which I got to try last year during a trip to the company’s R\u0026D office in Redmond.) \n\nHere are some things Zuckerberg said that stood out in our interview:\n\n* He has been thinking about decentralized social media for a while and is open to bringing other apps besides Threads to open protocols like ActivityPub. “My view is that the more that there’s interoperability between different services and the more content can flow, the better all the services can be. And I guess I’m just confident enough that we can build the best one of the services, that I actually think that we’ll benefit and we’ll be able to build better quality products by making sure that we can have access to all of the different content from wherever anyone is creating it.”\n* Meta is starting to work on interoperability with messaging apps it doesn’t own. I had yet to hear anyone at the company publicly acknowledge this until Zuckerberg mentioned it. “The plan was always to start with interop between our services, but then get to that. We’re starting to experiment with that, too.” (That may be the case, but I’d be remiss not to note that Meta has to do this as part of new regulation in the EU that goes into effect next year.)\n* It sounds like the US government isn’t close to regulating AI. Zuckerberg attended the recent Senate hearing on AI with a bunch of other tech CEOs: “There’s sort of the meme that it’s like, ‘Okay, a lot of these politicians, they go to a place where they’ll get attention for themselves.’ But, you know, this was a three-hour event, and I think there were like 40 senators sitting and listening and taking notes and not really participating in the discussion but just there to learn.” \n* He sees open-sourcing Meta’s AI technology as a strategic advantage. “We believe that it’s generally positive to open-source a lot of our infrastructure for a few reasons. One is that we don’t have a cloud business, right? So it’s not like we’re selling access to the infrastructure, so giving it away is fine. And then, when we do give it away, we generally benefit from innovation from the ecosystem, and when other people adopt the stuff, it increases volume and drives down prices.”\n* He is very aware of the closed-model AI companies shit-talking his open-source approach behind his back. “I hear either overtly or sometimes behind closed doors, something will get back to me that’s like, ‘Oh, this company was talking about why they’re kind of against open source.’ And it’s like, yeah, well, their whole business depends on selling access to proprietary models, so I think you have to be careful about that.”\n* Meta is working on the next version of Llama and hasn’t decided whether to open-source it or not. “We’re training the next version of Llama now, and I think we’ll probably have the same set of debates around that and how we should release it. And again, I sort of, like, lean toward wanting to do it open source, but I think we need to do all the red teaming and understand the risks before making a call.”\n* Stay tuned for an “AI Studio” product sometime next year that lets creators and businesses make their own bespoke AIs. “That will make it so that anyone can build their own AIs, sort of just like you create your own UGC, your own content across social networks.”\n* AI is going to supercharge Meta’s new smart glasses soon. “This isn’t in the first software release, but sometime early next year, we’re also going to have this multimodality. So you’re gonna be able to ask the AI, ‘Hey, what is it that I’m looking at? What type of plant is that? Where am I? How expensive is this thing?’ So now I think we’re at this point where it may actually be the case that for smart glasses, the AI is compelling before the holograms and the displays are.”\n* He thinks last year’s Quest Pro headset was too expensive. (I think it had other problems, Mark!) “And what we’ve seen so far is that at least consumers are very cost-conscious. We expected to sell way fewer Quest Pros than Quest 2s, and that [bore] out. It’s always hard to predict exactly what it’ll be when you’re shipping a product at $1,500 for the first time, but it was kind of fine. Within expectations — it wasn’t like a grand slam, but it did fine.”\n* Social experiences have overtaken gaming on the Quest in terms of time spent. This sounds like a very recent change, likely aided by Roblox coming to the platform.\n* Meta is having difficulty bringing down the cost of its full-fledged AR glasses, which represent the biggest portion of the Reality Labs budget. “It’s this fundamentally kind of counterintuitive thing where I think humans get super impressed by building big things, like the pyramids. I think a lot of time, building small things, like cures for diseases at a cellular level or miniaturizing a supercomputer to fit into your glasses, are maybe even bigger feats than building some really physically large things, but it seems less impressive for some reason.”\n\n---\n\n[Image: Evan Spiegel. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-vH0JURsZguZekbfYl9MFnhzso=/0x0:501x501/501x501/filters:focal(251x251:252x252)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24722493/Command_Line_Evan_Spiegel.jpg]\n\nSnap’s cuts\n\nOn Tuesday evening, I broke the news that Snap was about to lay off roughly 150 employees in its AR division. The next morning, the company announced that it’s axing the enterprise AR shopping group that was just unveiled in April. The idea was to sell Snap’s AR software to retailers like Nike so that their customers could virtually try on clothes and shoes.\n\n“After exploring our options over the past few months, it became clear that it would take significant incremental investment to grow our enterprise offering for retailers and we simply cannot make that investment at this time,” CEO Evan Spiegel told employees in an internal memo announcing the cuts, which I’ve heard were decided after a detailed review of the company’s AR strategy by upper management. Jill Popelka, a former exec at the enterprise giant SAP who joined less than two years ago to lead the division (and spoke onstage at Snap’s splashy developer conference earlier this year), is out.\n\nGiven Snap’s financial position, Spiegel is right to cut back on projects that aren’t core to the business. But it’s impossible not to see these layoffs as anything other than an unforced error. “Really a shame to see another 150 people let go after 6 months because of poor leadership from the top,” Evan Orenstein, an early Snap employee, wrote on X. “Where does the buck stop?\n\nSnap’s stock-based compensation is still through the roof, and given how its stock price has barely budged this week, I have a feeling that these cuts may not be the last.\n\n---\n\n[Image: Tim Sweeney. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAIpKPxsU3gWo9sl5LKRYI9kny4=/0x0:501x501/501x501/filters:focal(251x251:252x252)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24698906/Command_Line_Tim_Sweeney.jpeg]\n\nBad news at Epic Games\n\nIn a recent issue of this newsletter, I said that Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, was preparing for a significant round of layoffs. Yesterday, they were announced by CEO Tim Sweeney. Sixteen percent of employees, or about 830 people, are being laid off, along with roughly 250 leaving through the divesting of Bandcamp and SuperAwesome, two companies Epic acquired during the pandemic.\n\n“For a while now, we’ve been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators,” Sweeney said in his note to employees. “I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic.” \n\nHe framed the cuts as a refocusing on the core business and noted that Fortnite’s push to share more revenue with creators and compete with Roblox has driven down margins. Laid-off employees will get accelerated stock vesting through 2024 and will be given two more years to exercise. Epic is unusual for such a large, late-stage private company in that it doesn’t issue RSUs but rather options to employees, which can be expensive to exercise. Whether employees can get liquidity soon after exercising is another issue entirely that Epic has yet to address.\n\nAs I reported before, Epic held talks to raise more money this year but recently put a round on hold. I could see these cuts as a prerequisite to raising down the line on more favorable terms, though the company isn’t saying anything about that right now.\n\n---\n\nThe watercooler\n\nA roundup of what else happened in the tech industry this week that you may have missed:\n\n* Sam Altman, Jony Ive, and Masayoshi Son are talking about raising as much as $1 billion to build an AI-powered phone.
