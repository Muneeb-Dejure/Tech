    <title>Ampler introduces an all-road electric bike alongside series refresh</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXoNQtwjZT8tHmvVaz4lURn0Qrw=/2x0:2047x1363/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73209002/curt_anyroad_highstep_silver_rear_configurator.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curt Anyroad in silver.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ampler&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="98fsVP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://amplerbikes.com/en"&gt;Ampler&lt;/a&gt; — one of our favorite European e-bike makers — is back with a 2024 model refresh that includes a new all-road variant of the sporty Curt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdgUBj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://amplerbikes.com/en/e-bikes/curt-anyroad#configurator"&gt;Curt Anyroad&lt;/a&gt; is available with either a high- or low-step frame, the latter being easier to step through when sitting on a fully loaded bike. Both are otherwise identical, offering wider tires, fork mounts for some light gear bags, and a new 10-speed pedal-assisted drivetrain. That should make it suitable for more terrain but it lacks any kind of suspension for dampening bumps. The all-road edition takes the Curt up from a feathery (for an e-bike) 14.4kg (about 32 pounds) to 16.9kg, and still fits riders from small to large. Prices start at a tax-inclusive €3,690 (about $4,000). Shipments being June 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vT1Ayw"&gt;The refresh also brings a new low-step variation of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17817064/ampler-curt-electric-bike-review"&gt;single-speed, belt-driven Curt&lt;/a&gt; (€3,690), as well as new colors for the relaxed Stellar (€3,290), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18484541/ampler-stout-e-bike-review-its-not-easy-being-green"&gt;sturdy Stout&lt;/a&gt; (€3,290), upright Juna (€2,790), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23611678/ampler-electric-bike-review-sporty-commuter-europe"&gt;sporty yet practical Axel&lt;/a&gt; (€2,790) e-bikes.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ampler&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ampler is good at colors, including this lavender Curt Anyroad shown in both low- and high-step.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sH26Ai"&gt;All Ampler e-bikes feature non-removable batteries that power a European standard 250W rear-hub motor with a max speed of 25km/h, and include a two-year warranty, 14-day returns, and service centers available across Europe should things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grid’s framed, nostalgia-inducing gadgets are up to 40 percent off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/megjC0_X00lY_3IC9cfGXrB4AHw=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73201775/Grid_Game_Boy_Color_Press_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The framed edition of the atomic purple Game Boy Color is nearly $30 off for a limited time.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Grid&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="slYX1w"&gt;Of all the tech-centric artwork I’ve seen over the years, few pieces have grabbed me as much as Grid Studio’s framed gadgets and gizmos. The company has been slinging the collage-like pieces for several years now, taking oft-forgotten devices once destined for the landfill and putting them on full display in classy shadowbox-style frames with exploded views. And now, thanks to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgridstudio.cc%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F12%2F24097671%2Fgrid-studio-framed-tech-sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones-oppenheimer-blu-ray-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;annual spring sales event&lt;/a&gt;, Grid is offering up to 40 percent off select items through the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2hkTTU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Frame has become such a hit that Samsung is making a speaker version","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/7/24029243/samsung-music-frame-speaker-announced-specs-features"},{"title":"How to modernize your retro game collection in a few convoluted steps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24072166/retro-classic-game-roms-nfc-mister-how-to-modern"},{"title":"It’s clearly time: all the news about the transparent tech renaissance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23774468/clear-transparent-tech-gadgets-news-announcements-products"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pwo4hK"&gt;There are plenty of retro and contemporary items to choose from, from controllers to smartphones to gaming consoles that once dominated the handheld market in the US. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgridstudio.cc%2Fproducts%2Fgrid%25C2%25AE4s&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F12%2F24097671%2Fgrid-studio-framed-tech-sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones-oppenheimer-blu-ray-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone 4S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgridstudio.cc%2Fproducts%2Fgrid%25C2%25AE-nes-controller&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F12%2F24097671%2Fgrid-studio-framed-tech-sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones-oppenheimer-blu-ray-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;original NES controller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— both of which are on sale for $99 ($70 off), matching their all-time low — are the most notable at 40 percent off, though you can also save 15 percent on an assortment of other pieces when you clip the on-page coupon or use promo code &lt;strong&gt;SP15 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. Personally, I’m partial to the see-through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgridstudio.cc%2Fproducts%2Fgame-boy-color&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F12%2F24097671%2Fgrid-studio-framed-tech-sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones-oppenheimer-blu-ray-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (now $161.15) as well as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgridstudio.cc%2Fproducts%2Fgrid%25C2%25AE-motorola-razr-v3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F12%2F24097671%2Fgrid-studio-framed-tech-sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones-oppenheimer-blu-ray-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motorola’s iconic Razr V3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (now $126.65) and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgridstudio.cc%2Fproducts%2Fgrid%25C2%25AE-ipod-photo&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F12%2F24097671%2Fgrid-studio-framed-tech-sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones-oppenheimer-blu-ray-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPod Photo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (now $169.15) from ’04. After all, I’m an absolute sucker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/21/18105423/ipod-click-wheel-button-music-control-hardware-design"&gt;for a good click wheel&lt;/a&gt; and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="L28R31"&gt;Sony has long been a player in the personal audio space, but in the last decade or so, it’s really become known for premium noise-canceling headphones like the &lt;strong&gt;WH-1000XM5&lt;/strong&gt;. Thankfully, if you want to see what all the fuss is about, Amazon is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/0bc5d519/"&gt;hosting an expansive sale&lt;/a&gt; on all things Sony, dropping discounts on headphones, gaming headsets, earbuds, and various pieces of home theater equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UX0UyG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"},{"title":"Sony’s InZone gaming monitors and headsets are for more than just PS5 gamers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/28/23180410/sony-inzone-gaming-monitors-hands-on-specs-price-ps5-pc"},{"title":"You can grab a PS5 with Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 for $399.99 right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/9/24094340/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-bundle-spider-man-2-ipad-pro-m1-m2-deal-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k1i8Nx"&gt;On the headphone front, the XM5 are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B0BXYCS74H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $328 ($72 off)&lt;/a&gt;, which matches one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on the over-ears to date. You can also pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last-gen WH-1000XM4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which offer an identical set of features, great sound, and a foldable design — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $248 ($100 off)&lt;/a&gt;, along with the step-down &lt;strong&gt;WH-CH720N&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-CH720N-Canceling-Headphones-Microphone/dp/B0BS74M665?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$128 ($22 off)&lt;/a&gt;. Last but not least are the &lt;strong&gt;LinkBuds S&lt;/strong&gt;, a pair of wireless earbuds that offer supreme comfort, strong voice call performance, and effective ANC &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-LinkBuds-Wireless-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B09YL76VSR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $148 ($52 off)&lt;/a&gt;. You can even snag the purple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23889814/sony-olivia-rodrigo-linkbuds-s-announced-guts-sour"&gt;Olivia Rodrigo edition&lt;/a&gt; of the latter &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-LinkBuds-Wireless-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0CHZ8J9LC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for an all-time low of $168&lt;/a&gt; ($32 off), which nets you two custom EQ modes that are optimized for each of Rodrigo’s albums: &lt;em&gt;Sour&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="96hJhc"&gt;One of the coolest things about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23765921/google-pixel-tablet-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel Tablet&lt;/a&gt; is its color-matched speaker dock, which attaches via magnets and allows you to use your slate as an ad hoc smart display. The tablet comes with one by default; however, if you’d like a second &lt;strong&gt;Charging Speaker Dock&lt;/strong&gt; to place somewhere else in your home, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C289CD17/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clOqAIewHjA"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the standalone device starting at $77.99 ($51 off).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lpabrg"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apple’s latest AirPods Pro &lt;/strong&gt;— aka the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best pair of earbuds for iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; or anyone locked into the Apple ecosystem — have returned to their all-time low of around $189 ($60 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0CHWRXH8B/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C%2F5020133971%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://howl.me/clOqFPs8sJz"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The newest model touts the same great sound quality and ANC as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23365910/apple-airpods-pro-second-generation-review"&gt;second-gen model&lt;/a&gt; from 2022, except the latest iteration also features dust resistance and ships with a USB-C charging case instead of the Lightning-only model that came with Apple’s previous earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review"&gt;Read our hands-on impressions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="78y805"&gt;2023 was a colossal year for gaming, with blockbuster titles such as &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate 3, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leading the public discourse. If you didn’t have a chance to tackle the excellent &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lies of P&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, however, the PC version is on sale via &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.humblebundle.com/store/lies-of-p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt; for $44.99 ($15 off). The action RPG is essentially a bloody gothic reimagining of &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio &lt;/em&gt;with a punishing learning curve, the kind best suited for fans of &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;, and other difficult games that leave you more and more deflated with every session (sigh).&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Gazelle launches ‘first and only’ Class 3 e-bike with Bosch Smart System in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man straddles his Gazelle e-bike while looking down the road ahead as a snow-capped mountain cap looms in the distance." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQFdzVqqsNhQVS9FCTdXkX-8Z_Q=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73200610/Gazelle_Eclipse_C380_HMB__45_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This belt-driven C380 HMB with high-step frame can handle more than flat Dutch cities.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gazelle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nHNDFy"&gt;Gazelle, the very popular Dutch bike brand owned by industry giant Pon Holdings, is launching its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20904414/electric-bikes-ebike-guide-rideables-battery-how-to-buy-price"&gt;Class 3 electric bike&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnVNz4"&gt;Gazelle says that its new Eclipse is the “first and only Class 3 e-bike in the US to feature &lt;a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/the-smart-system"&gt;Bosch’s Smart System&lt;/a&gt;,” which fully integrates the bike’s motor and electronics with the Bosch Flow app for a personalized ride that will receive continuous over-the-air bug fixes and feature updates long after purchase. Class 3 in the US is defined as pedal-assist only, no throttle, and a maximum speed of 28 mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpyx6Z"&gt;Eclipse is available in both high- and low-step frames and built to easily handle heavy loads and hills on a variety of terrain. It features wide 60mm tires, a front shock, Shimano MT-420 four-piston hydraulic disc brakes, a large 750Wh battery, and a mid-drive Bosh motor with an impressive 85Nm of torque and 28mph top speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOsyjR"&gt;Specifically, these e-bikes feature a smart version of Bosch’s &lt;a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/products/performance-line-speed"&gt;Performance Line Speed Motor&lt;/a&gt; offering an Auto mode that automatically adjusts power delivery to compensate for hills or headwinds, not unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/9/23631943/cowboy-e-bike-adaptive-power-specs-price"&gt;Cowboy’s adaptive power&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a walk-assist feature that helps push it up hills and prevent rollback as well as route planning in the Flow app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8osfBx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZ2-xXOFEvo?rel=0&amp;amp;start=79" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M9OMEy"&gt;One potentially useful feature of the Bosch Smart System recently introduced in version 1.8 is the “Dynamic Display” mode which automatically changes the information presented on Bosch’s Kiox displays so that the most relevant data is always shown to the rider. Climbing? It shows your power, cadence, and elevation. Descending? It switches to focus on speed, before switching again to add distance travelled and range overview when you hit the flats. When at a standstill it then shows summary information like maximum speed of your journey, distance travelled, elevation change, and range remaining. The Kiox can also now show a clear elevation graph for the planned trip, as well as the rider’s current position.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8Ea06f8fl1Safbm0pjL6Uv0B5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25299087/Gazelle_Eclipse_T11_HMB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gazelle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chain-driven Eclipse T11 HMB with low-step frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6QssmB"&gt;Gazelle’s Eclipse e-bikes also come fitted with an MIK-compatible rear rack and integrated front and rear lighting. They also come with a very Dutch cafe lock (or ring lock, if you prefer) that’s bolted into the frame to quickly lock the back wheel..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1ivyH"&gt;The Eclipse comes in two models. The 11-speed T11 HMB is the chain-driven model with Shimano Deore XT derailleur and $5,499 price tag. The Eclipse C380 HMB is the model I’d pick — despite costing a bit more at $5,999 — due to its Gates belt drive and smooth shifting Enviolo CVT stepless hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UQT0M2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:12259518"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="251gh9"&gt;Yeah, those are premium prices but that price is still a hell of a lot less than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23852125/car-ownership-cost-increasing-us-public-transit-e-bikes"&gt;on-going costs to own a car&lt;/a&gt; which this Class 3 e-bike can replace for some. And wouldn’t it be nice to get a little exercise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJLO5I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rad Power Bikes debuts fire-resistant batteries — and four new e-bike models</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="RadWagon 5 electric cargo bike" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KFz2rwgGiRQyWsO5bxWExV0KHeI=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73183791/528360_AMY_Rad_2024_Digital_30_12edef_original_1709312424.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rad Power Bikes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QtawhS"&gt;As electric bikes become more popular in the US, the risk of deadly fires stemming from cheaply made batteries has become an unfortunate side effect that risks derailing the momentum of &lt;a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2023/12/11/e-bikes-are-radically-more-efficient-than-electric-cars/"&gt;an important climate change fighting tool&lt;/a&gt;. That helps explain why Rad Power Bikes, the leading e-bike manufacturer in the US, is releasing new battery technology that it says can help usher in a new era of safety for the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XKab8"&gt;Today, the company is announcing four new models with new state-of-the-art batteries designed to better prevent malfunctions that can cause the types of fires that are becoming increasingly common among cheaper e-bike brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0QvyL"&gt;The new models include a refreshed RadWagon, the company’s bestselling electric cargo bike, as well as the RadExpand, its folding bike. And there are two brand-new models: the Radster Road and Radster Trail. Each bike will feature the Seattle-based company’s new “Safe Shield”-branded batteries with “thermal resistant technology” designed to prevent battery fires. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BE7w_Owv-sceaYh816wvwk7nOtc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25318011/528389_AMY_Rad_2024_Digital_154_6306f3_original_1709312549.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of Rad’s new batteries will sport the Safe Shield branding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0Snuk8"&gt;The batteries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="eGtGPY"&gt;Rad accomplished this by injecting an epoxy resin into the battery cells, which it claims will prevent a chemical reaction in the battery that can cause it to heat up to the point of exploding, also known as a thermal runaway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5zYSP"&gt;“The reason for that resin is to help thermal propagation,” said Sarah Bruce Courtney, head of product development at Rad Power Bikes, in an interview. “So with an encapsulation, we’re actually helping protect moisture ingress and corrosion. It’s also protecting our cells, so it’s actually helping isolate any thermal activity that can happen within the battery cell itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="USQhJh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s actually helping isolate any thermal activity that can happen within the battery cell itself”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5K9h2h"&gt;Poorly made e-bike batteries have been implicated in numerous deadly fires across the US and the UK. In New York City alone, where tens of thousands of delivery workers ride around on e-bikes every day, dozens of people have been killed in fires linked to faulty lithium-ion batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecFtLX"&gt;New York City officials are cracking down, requiring e-bikes to be UL-certified and setting up public charging locations to prevent delivery workers from charging their batteries in residential apartment buildings using noncompliant equipment. Other towns are considering more punitive measures, indicating that fire fears could prove to be a major disruption for the e-bike industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RealY2"&gt;To date, there has only been one reported incident of a Rad e-bike allegedly catching fire, though the company denies it. (It later reached a settlement with State Farm insurance on behalf of the homeowners who claim their house was damaged.) The company has shipped over 600,000 bikes in its history, mostly to customers in the US. Nonetheless, the company says it’s determined to lead by example in adopting the new fire-resistant battery technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fn3NXW"&gt;Rad Power Bikes has taken other safety steps, including shifting to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.18650batterystore.com%2Fcollections%2F21700-batteries&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F5%2F24090135%2Frad-power-bikes-battery-safety-radster-radwagon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;21,700 cells&lt;/a&gt; (21mm in diameter and 70mm in length) from the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.18650batterystore.com%2Fcollections%2F18650-batteries&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F3%2F5%2F24090135%2Frad-power-bikes-battery-safety-radster-radwagon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;18,650 cells&lt;/a&gt; for its batteries and complying with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23868264/rad-power-bikes-ul-certification-ebike-battery-fires"&gt;UL safety certification&lt;/a&gt; for both its bikes and batteries. Courtney described the 21,700 cells as “the newer battery cell that a lot of the automotive industry is moving to,” with more efficiency built in. As a result, the company also moved from a 14 amp-hour battery to a 15 amp-hour one to accommodate the change in cell size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxDERK"&gt;“If we look at the batteries in the cells, they go beyond any industry standard,” Rad Power Bikes CEO Phil Molyneux said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mjrpDjLlEyAd8NmcW_tt6woNyyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25318013/528309_Wagon_5_Metallic_Blue_Left_Side_34d573_original_1709311323.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RadWagon 5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UkROxP"&gt;The bikes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="reucZF"&gt;The new models that are being introduced today as well as the new battery technology are all about “ushering in a new era for Rad,” Molyneux said. With upgraded specs, a bevy of new paint options, and improved performance, the new models are intended to help the company set the stage for a banner year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTpdSP"&gt;The Radster is the newest model to join Rad’s lineup, and hallelujah, it comes with torque sensors. The more natural feel from torque sensors, as opposed to cadence ones, is why most high-end brands include them, so it’s great to see Rad join the fray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gP5Exf"&gt;The Radster comes in two variations, Trail and Road, for either off-road fun or daily commutes. It will also have the option to toggle between Class 2 and Class 3 settings, which would allow it to reach speeds of up to 28mph. That might be too fast for some e-bikers, especially those in Europe, where Class 3 is essentially nonexistent, but here in the US, we love our speed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QUxM3a7mV1ZJ0tGCNY25Mtx-3Tg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25318015/528530_Radster_Trail_Regular_Copper_Red_Right_Angle_e823bf_original_1709322764.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Radster Trail﻿.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G1VOSV"&gt;In addition to the Radster, the company is also releasing updated versions of its popular RadWagon cargo bike and RadExpand folding bike. The original RadWagon helped kick off the electric cargo bike revolution in the US when it was first released in 2015. Now in its fifth generation, the new RadWagon will have better handling, increased payload capacity, and a front suspension (another hallelujah for that) for a smoother ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwlcXV"&gt;To improve rider control and stability, Rad condensed the frame and lowered the bike’s center of gravity so that it can now accommodate a wider range of rider sizes. The RadWagon’s motor can also draw more energy from the battery to generate more torque for better hill climbing, even while hauling a heavy load. And it will also be able to toggle between Class 2 and 3, depending on speed preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="be9Ag5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:12269392"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfULRN"&gt;Lastly, the RadExpand 5 Plus is newly improved with more payload capacity and hydraulic front suspension for a smoother ride. And all of Rad’s new models are getting a full-color display with USB-C charging capabilities and rear turn signals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnsgSl"&gt;The RadWagon 5 will retail for $2,199, while the Radster will start at $1,999 and the RadExpand at $1,899. All four models will be available to ship to customers later this spring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="re5TSL"&gt;But the new batteries in particular are meant to position the company at the forefront of the industry in terms of safety. Molyneux said the company would extend its current one-year warranty on all of its bikes to two years as a sign of renewed confidence in the product. And the hope is that other companies will follow suit, which should help discourage property owners and towns from passing regulations to ban e-bikes altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Achv68"&gt;“We have to bang the drum and say, ‘Okay, there is better ways to do this,’” Molyneux said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN4qYG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York City is testing public e-bike charging stations for delivery workers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jq0bs0"&gt;New York City &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/news/012-24/mayor-adams-activation-city-s-first-public-e-bike-charging-site-delivery-workers"&gt;opened its first public e-bike charging station&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, part of a six-month pilot program to “support safe e-bike use and prevent deadly lithium-ion battery fires.” E-bike-related fires in the city killed 18 people and injured 150 in 2023 alone, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/nyregion/ebike-charging-station-nyc.html"&gt;according to&lt;em&gt; The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8dzu4"&gt;The new charging station in Cooper Square in the East Village will be available to 100 delivery workers free of charge during the pilot program. The city plans to open four other stations across Brooklyn and Manhattan “in the coming weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwv2JV"&gt;“We count on delivery workers for so much, and they should be able to count on us, too — whether that means fighting for fair pay or making their jobs and livelihoods safer,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lFVMz"&gt;Poorly made e-bike batteries have been implicated in numerous deadly fires caused by unsafe charging practices. A fire department spot-check of locations where multiple e-bikes were being charged &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/01/31/ebike-battery-fire-hazards-fdny/"&gt;found that&lt;/a&gt; 3 in 4 dangerous instances were in residential buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujai9r"&gt;New York City’s density, as well as expensive rents and the high cost of living, means that sometimes multiple delivery workers live in a single apartment. A &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/02/26/fazil-khan-journalist-ebike-fire/"&gt;blaze in February that killed one person&lt;/a&gt; was started by a lithium-ion battery being charged in a unit shared by six delivery workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Charging technologies used in the city’s pilot, produced by Swobbee, Swiftmile, and Popwheels." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xnz9_FZY6vBdvDf8_bBvsaQNauk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25313070/pr927_23.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S6RTYC"&gt;There’s also the problem of &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/11/everything-you-need-to-know-about-e-bike-battery-fires"&gt;cheap, low-quality e-bikes and batteries&lt;/a&gt; that are more likely to explode. There are ways to reduce this risk, like purchasing products with a UL safety certification. The public charging stations, equipped with swappable battery systems and locking charging racks, were reviewed by the New York City Fire Department during development and installation, the city said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gS7FL"&gt;Delivery workers interested in participating in the program can fill out an &lt;a href="https://airtable.com/appeTXUFZTLrtXIKN/shrrt7z5pJxEN1f3a?"&gt;expression of interest form&lt;/a&gt; or attend an onboarding event. Events will be held at Cooper Square on March 7th, 2024, from 2PM to 5PM and at the Brooklyn Army Terminal on March 8th, 2024, from 2PM to 5PM.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A crowd destroyed a driverless Waymo car in San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Firefighters spraying a Waymo car." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpOa1pTHM1MOmgNTuZvbyagO0bg=/98x0:2218x1413/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73130782/Screenshot_2024_02_11_at_11.34.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefighters attempt to put out the Waymo car.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SJO3EbR-_w" target="_blank"&gt;FriscoLive415&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldXTRT"&gt;A person jumped on the hood of a Waymo driverless taxi and smashed its windshield in San Francisco’s Chinatown last night around 9PM PT, generating applause before a crowd formed around the car and covered it in spray paint, breaking its windows, and ultimately set it on fire. The fire department arrived minutes later, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theautopian.com/a-mob-just-vandalized-and-set-a-waymo-self-driving-car-on-fire-and-the-videos-are-nuts/"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The Autopian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but by then flames had already fully engulfed the car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLu0NK"&gt;At the moment, no outlets seem to have reported a motive for the attack. Waymo representative Sandy Karp told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;via email that the fully autonomous car “was not transporting any riders” when it was attacked and fireworks were tossed inside the car, sparking the flames. Public Information Officer Robert Rueca of San Francisco’s police department confirmed in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that police responded at “approximately” 8:50PM PT to find the car already on fire, adding that there were “no reports of injuries.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3h1J3L"&gt;A video posted by the FriscoLive415 YouTube channel shows the burnt-out husk of the electric Waymo Jaguar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1KkZsP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SJO3EbR-_w?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HReMVw"&gt;Another set of videos posted by software developer Michael Vendi gives a view into the scene as it played out and the fire grew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V85a6l"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;happening NOW in SF. Waymo car vandalized &amp;amp; lit on fire  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sfchronicle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@sfchronicle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OEZYFiy6mv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OEZYFiy6mv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Vandi (@michael_vandi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michael_vandi/status/1756550257851449372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CntrJk"&gt;The fire takes place against the backdrop of simmering tension between San Francisco residents and automated vehicle operators. The California DMV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23930629/california-dmv-suspends-cruise-robotaxi-permit-safety"&gt;suspended Waymo rival Cruise’s robotaxi operations&lt;/a&gt; after one of its cars struck and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/3/23901233/cruise-crash-hit-run-pedestrian-injury-sf-robotaxi"&gt;dragged a pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; last year, and prior to that, automated taxis had caused chaos in the city, blocking traffic or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/18/23837217/cruise-robotaxi-driverless-crash-fire-truck-san-francisco"&gt;crashing into a fire truck&lt;/a&gt;. Just last week, a Waymo car &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065063/waymo-driverless-car-strikes-bicyclist-san-francisco-injuries"&gt;struck a cyclist&lt;/a&gt; who had reportedly been following behind a truck turning across its path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4L6gj3"&gt;City officials and residents opposed the cars being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23789905/waymo-cruise-sf-cpuc-vote-orange-cone"&gt;given a license for 24/7 operation&lt;/a&gt; last year, with some residents rendering them immobile by putting orange cones on the cars’ hoods in protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iK3cry"&gt;Vandalism and defacement are time-honored parts of the human experience, seen in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/11/nyregion/subway-graffiti-back-and-bothersome.html"&gt;subway cars in New York City&lt;/a&gt; or the walls of the &lt;a href="https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/2021-11-30/ty-article/largest-collection-of-ancient-graffiti-ever-found-in-pompeii-some-are-hysterically-funny/0000017f-dc01-d856-a37f-fdc1f53a0000"&gt;ancient destroyed city of Pompeii&lt;/a&gt;. Tech companies have been forced to reckon with this inevitability as they deploy their equipment in public with impunity. Scooters get tossed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/16/18141418/scooter-vandalism-rugged-bird-lime-spin-acton"&gt;into lakes&lt;/a&gt;, cars are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/7/23197041/waymo-self-driving-car-pedestrian-attack-arizona"&gt;punched by pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;, and in some places, dockless bike share bikes are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/26/17053408/gobee-bike-sharing-france-belgium"&gt;destroyed en masse&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cowboy expands at-home e-bike services to more riders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A repair technician examines a Cowboy e-bike along side its owner in front of a door in what looks like a European city." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VxlHP1X63OGdE5o3q8tEJXBz2NM=/0x0:7008x4672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73122658/DSC03610.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A technician will be dispatched to your location for prices starting at €69/£69. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Cowboy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cZlnJV"&gt;Cowboy, the boutique Belgian maker of e-bikes, is taking the training wheels off its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcowboy.com%2Fblogs%2Fpress%2Fon-demand-services&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F2%2F8%2F24066154%2Fcowboy-on-demand-flat-tire-repair-price-locations" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;On-Demand offering of ad hoc services&lt;/a&gt; previously being tested in just a few cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUURqW"&gt;That means owners of Cowboy e-bikes across Europe can now request flat tire fixes, bike setup, general maintenance, and the installation of child seats or rear racks right in the Cowboy app with prices starting at €69 / £69. Best of all, you don’t have to visit one of the company’s bike store partners since a technician will be dispatched directly to your doorstep. The On-Demand service is meant to complement Cowboy Care, the company’s subscription maintenance service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TV-acNjwxh9ornm0S0eYkXlfMMI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25274526/OND1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Cowboy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appointments can be booked and managed directly in the Cowboy app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gKOzMU"&gt;“It’s imperative that customers feel confident that when they invest in a Cowboy e-bike, they can service and maintain it at a time and place most convenient for them,” said Cowboy co-founder and CTO Tanguy Goretti a statement. “Continuously investing and improving our post-sales support is a huge part of our strategy this year and On-Demand is a big part of that, with more news to come in a few months time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBiWcp"&gt;The On-Demand service offering is now available nationwide in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg; as well as “the capitals region” for France, the UK, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, and Italy (including Milan); and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbSrl3"&gt;Additionally, Cowboy says it’s now partnered with 175 local bike retailers (up from about 100 last July) across Europe which currently provide over half of all customer repairs. It plans to partner with an additional 1,000 by the end of 2025 — which is ambitious, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITdsPY"&gt;These latest announcements come as Cowboy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/21/23801720/cowboy-profit-next-vanmoof-bankrupt"&gt;enters a period of sustained profitability&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in its existence, buoyed by the launch of its excellent new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23781704/cowboy-cruiser-e-bike-price-specs-test-ride"&gt;upright Cruiser model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Pq6OS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 8th, 1:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy corrected itself to say that by end of 2025, not end of 2024, it plans to partner with 1,000 additional bike shops. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gocycle’s CX lineup of electric cargo bikes are lightweight and foldable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pictured is a very clean-looking cargo bike with relatively small wheels, no exposed cables, and long telescoping seat tube, handlebar, and tail where all the cargo accessories can be mounted." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4e5-7-bIl-U7ua12ZqVivdxLX8M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73102716/Gocycle_CX__White_Rear_Side.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gocycle CX+ cargo e-bike has a unique Flofit handlebar.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gocycle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J1mwmG"&gt;Gocycle, the British e-bike company founded by a former McLaren car designer, has just taken the wraps off an innovative new electric cargo bike for families. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgocycle.com%2Fgocycle-fc%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F24054365%2Fgocycle-f1-cargo-e-bike-cx-series-longtail-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CX series&lt;/a&gt; of longtails are lightweight and foldable, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21211827/gocycle-gxi-review-price-foldable-electric-bike"&gt;you’d expect from Gocycle&lt;/a&gt;, with an intriguing new handlebar on the CX Plus model that can be quickly adapted for rider comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U80Q8y"&gt;Gocycle calls it Flofit, and it’s “probably the most adjustable-for-comfort handlebar ever developed!” says company founder and designer Richard Thorpe in a press release. “Adjustable in reach, grip angle, offering multiple hand positions, and of course foldable — it’s a game-changer for discerning urban e-bikers.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gg7w4gbcAbwmzejvVNmkQmFzULU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25254644/gocycle_cx_folding.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gocycle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fold the chassis, handlebar, then remove and store the saddle... and back again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zXLUa6"&gt;Maybe, but right now all we have is a promise and a bunch of image renders, not even photographs of a real bike. That’s not to say we can’t trust Gocycle — the company’s been making ultra-premium e-bikes since 2009, including fast foldables with integrated running lights, internal cable routing, a minimalistic display, and those weirdly cool side-mounted wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l53ow8"&gt;Gocycle says the CX weighs just 23kg (51 pounds), which is very light for a cargo e-bike, yet it can support up to 220kg (485 pounds) of total weight, including the rider, passengers, and cargo. For comparison, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20791435/radwagon-electric-cargo-bike-review-car-replacement"&gt;Rad Power RadWagon electric cargo bike&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t fold and weighs about 77 pounds with a 350-pound weight limit, but it’s also equipped with a much bigger battery and more powerful 750W motor for far less money. But let’s see you stuff a RadWagon into a train, elevator, or back of a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMC70b"&gt;As to the center kickstand’s ability to support such a massive load, Gocycle’s Thorpe had this to say in an email exchange with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Esl4yQ"&gt;“Gocycle has been a pioneer in dual-legged retractable center kickstands - and we have built up an enviable reputation for things that are lightweight, strong, and foldable! The new patent pending CX kickstand is designed and tested with a 220kg max load vehicle rating and multi passenger/rider loading-unloading use cases. It presents a formidable design and engineering challenge drawing on our many years of experience in the folding and compact wheel e-bike market segment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rjWCxD"&gt;The rear wooden deck (available in cherry or teak) on the CXi and CX Plus are compatible with &lt;a href="https://mikclickgo.com/en"&gt;MIK accessories&lt;/a&gt;, including child seats, pet carriers, panniers, and, eventually, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/4/23194215/formula-one-zhou-guanyu-halo-crash-survive"&gt;F1-inspired halo system&lt;/a&gt; from Gocycle to protect kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kpd8Ecm8lxHkUJ6z4LWWahptG9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25254552/LT_fr16_01_GunMetalGrey.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gocycle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;First fold in half.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ZSbPjYsMiQ9j07o3Zv0vpgt4Ac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25254556/LT_fr17_01_GunMetalGrey.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gocycle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then fold the handlebar and store the saddle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TQtz1A"&gt;As for the rest of the specs, the frame is a mix of alloy in front and carbon fiber in the rear. There’s also a carbon fiber wheel and fork and a 375Wh (10.4Ah / 36V) removable battery that charges in 3.5 hours with a claimed “up to 80km (50 miles)” range from the front-hub motor. In the US, you get a 500W motor with a 20mph top speed, which falls to the standard 25km/h and 250W mix for Europeans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FAkkdy"&gt;Front and rear hydraulic disk brakes help bring those 20 x 2.4-inch tires to a confident stop. The transmission is underpinned by a torque sensor for a more intuitive pedal assist, a five-speed Shimano Nexus hub with Gocycle’s predictive shifting, and a Gates CDX carbon belt drive instead of a long, oily chain and finicky derailleur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mr0GIv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:12236530"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dcxgNV"&gt;Gocycle’s e-bikes have never been cheap, and the CX family doesn’t change the situation. Nevertheless, these are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/18/23645151/cargo-ebike-electric-golden-age-prices-utility-dtc"&gt;cargo e-bikes which can replace cars&lt;/a&gt; for some families, including those paying $12,000 &lt;em&gt;each year&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23852125/car-ownership-cost-increasing-us-public-transit-e-bikes"&gt;to own and maintain a new car&lt;/a&gt; that’s likely sitting unused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557411/lynk-co-01-cheaper-as-you-share-volvo-geely-price-date"&gt;96 percent of the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aASt92"&gt;Preorders are open now starting at a suggested retail price of £5,999 (about €7,000 / $7,600) for the CXi model, jumping to £6,999 (about $8,860 / €8,210) for the CX Plus with first deliveries to the UK, US (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), and Europe expected to begin in September. Just know that you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgocycle.com%2Fgocycle-fc%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F24054365%2Fgocycle-f1-cargo-e-bike-cx-series-longtail-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;put down a £499 refundable deposit&lt;/a&gt; to guarantee your spot in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrhvHU"&gt;Gocycle has managed to survive the double-whammy of a boom / bust pandemic sales cycle followed by the sudden disappearance of “free” investor money. 2023 saw excess e-bike inventory flooding the market at fire-sale prices which was great for consumers but not so great for small boutique builders. “That’s been hard for a company like Gocycle focused on value innovation, thoughtful design, and pride in maintaining our industry leading 4.5 star customer service rating,” says Thorpe. “The era of relentless discounting will eventually fade, and with that, we hope urban e-bike customers and dealers will value innovation over a cheap deal or free stock.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The hubless electric motorcycle with sci-fi style and a great name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OI-igJAsinCGad9-9_L0VNpQKJU=/232x0:2727x1663/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73031416/Verge_TS_Ultra_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Verge Motorcycles’ 360-degree sensors could make the wild TS Ultra safer than anything else on two wheels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SeAndR"&gt;Modern cars are riddled with sensors looking in every direction, most taxed with one simple duty: keep you safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elsvu3"&gt;Motorcycles are a lot simpler. Riders are literally hung out in the wind, left with little more than their reflexes, skills, and situational awareness to keep them safe. Even essential safety tech like anti-lock brakes and traction control are relatively new additions to the two-wheel scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oH7IDX"&gt;But that’s changing, and it looks like Finland’s Verge Motorcycles (no relation) could lead the pack with the most advanced rider safety system on two wheels when the Verge TS Ultra launches later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aU8MtRxfjwXt3d2HSWvNEOk83t0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25208536/VergeYellowField.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QXanr2"&gt;Big power, weird motor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R5j5nu"&gt;The TS looks like nothing else on the road because it is like nothing else on the road. It’s electric, for starters, making it still a rare thing in the world of motorcycles, but its performance is even more radical. It has a whopping 201 horsepower and 885 pound-feet of torque, almost twice as much as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23554163/chevy-corvette-e-ray-hybrid-awd-price-specs-photos"&gt;Corvette E-Ray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8INVfr"&gt;That torque comes from an unusual source. When coming up with the initial design for a motorcycle in 2018, Verge Motorcycles CTO Marko Lehtimäki said that the team was unhappy with the few electric motorcycles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qaVeA"&gt;He said that most electric motorcycle designs simply replace the basic layout of a gas-powered motorcycle, swapping an engine for a motor and a gas tank for a battery. “We thought that cannot be optimal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKFBj9"&gt;Placing the battery high in the frame was one particular concern. “These batteries are very heavy,” he said. “The center of gravity gets high and these are top-heavy and not very enjoyable experiences compared to traditional motorcycling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0GRFOl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It has a whopping 201 horsepower and 885 pound-feet of torque, almost twice as much as a Corvette E-Ray&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pR7wDT"&gt;Verge Motorcycles’ engineers knew they needed to put the battery down in the bottom of the frame, keeping the center of gravity as low as possible. But by dropping the battery to the base, they filled up the space usually occupied by a motor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0isCE"&gt;“We came to a conclusion that we would need to move the motor outside of the main chassis, out of the body of the motorcycle,” he said. So they decided to try something different by putting the motor inside the rear wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPCYJr"&gt;In-wheel electric motors are not exactly rare. In fact, they’re common in the e-bike scene, found on options like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23715026/vanmoof-s4-review-price-specs-date"&gt;VanMoof S4&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632227/bird-electric-bike-owned-price-specs-scooter"&gt;Bird Bike&lt;/a&gt;. The TS Ultra’s motor, though, is something different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDKlVJ"&gt;It’s a hubless ring design, which means you can put your hand right through the center of the wheel. This creates a radical look, and while it does have some drawbacks — namely, adding a lot of weight hanging off the rear suspension — Lehtimäki said the practical benefits of that battery placement more than outweigh it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vW9JwM"&gt;“We did a prototype, and let’s say that was not a very easy path,” Lehtimäki said. “Even when we got the prototype working, people thought that we were crazy, and many were saying that that would never work in real life. But we just were very convinced this is the future, and if we can make this work, it will change everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPe2vs"&gt;The result is an inadvertent head-turner. “We didn’t start from ‘Let’s create something that looks like a Tron bike,’ we started from how can we make a better motorcycle with a completely redesigned EV architecture,” he said. “The answer was this ring motor.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZnuJKnUQoIVTeCZozZgp5XScytc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25208537/Starmatter_Vision___Hero.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cq97r1"&gt;Sensor package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jx6K73"&gt;While the look of the bike is unique, the way the bike will look back at the world is equally novel. At this year’s CES in Las Vegas, Verge Motorcycles will unveil a new sensor package to be included with the TS Ultra, the top trim of the company’s debut motorcycle. The company calls it Starmatter Vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGzWOR"&gt;Six cameras will peer in all directions, enabling full 360 sensing around the bike. Those will be augmented by two high-resolution radar units, one looking ahead and another looking back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vDm3M"&gt;Lehtimäki declined to say who’s providing the radar units for inclusion on the bike, only saying that they are “the best quality you can get on the market.” They’ll be used to identify obstacles on the road ahead or fast-approaching vehicles from behind, while the cameras will also scan for anything in the way to the left or right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tm8eRe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Six cameras will peer in all directions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="reSldD"&gt;All of those warnings will be communicated to the rider through a variety of channels. The most significant will be the pair of displays. The gauge cluster above the handlebars will show most of the data, but another display, sitting on top of the tank, will provide even more detail on what’s going on around the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNRN82"&gt;All of this will be presented using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/5/23905082/epic-unreal-engine-pricing-change-film-automotive"&gt;Unreal Engine&lt;/a&gt;, meaning high-end 3D graphics on an embedded motorcycle display for the first time. It’s all part of a software package Verge Motorcycles calls Starmatter, all fully updatable via the bike’s integrated wireless connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="joYoOQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/shv1iiL5fgQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SjmtRz"&gt;However, looking down at the pretty ray tracing isn’t exactly the best idea when you’re riding along the highway at upward of 70mph. So, the Verge Motorcycles TS will also connect with in-helmet audio systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXSSUm"&gt;“It’s the combination of these that we are quite excited about. In general, we think that audio, especially spatial audio, is really a really important part of the experience,” Lehtimäki said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIyad1"&gt;Spatial audio would point to some sort of a next-generation helmet audio system beyond what’s readily available on the market today, but Lehtimäki declined to share more details on what exactly that might look like — or sound like, for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q01S292cLXpuZq9b15bf5F4nCT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25208540/Verge_TS_Ultra_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eKzp8z"&gt;Start saving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ckI1Lm"&gt;While we don’t know exactly how the audio feedback of the TS Ultra will work, we do know that all of this will be extremely costly. The TS Ultra has a starting price of $44,900. For that, you get the bike with the sensors and up to 233 miles of range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PL0beE"&gt;If that doesn’t fit within your budget, Verge Motorcycles does have the $29,900 TS Pro, with 137 horsepower and 217 miles of range, or the base $26,900 TS, with 107 horsepower and 155 miles of range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDXomC"&gt;Not only do you give up power and range but you’ll also say goodbye to the advanced sensing package. For now, Lehtimäki says that those sensors are too pricey to include on the lower-end bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CHTn7k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All of this will be extremely costly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sgmj17"&gt;But since all of the Verge Motorcycles TS models are OTA updatable, and they all feature the same internal sensors (including GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope), the stability and traction control systems driving every model will evolve along the same path, getting ever better at dealing with things like inclement conditions and heavy-handed new riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="yd2wQs"&gt;Verge Motorcycles says they’ll start shipping to American consumers sometime in the summer of this year, exclusively through direct sales to start. That’s about a six-month slip behind what the company was promising this time last year, but Verge Motorcycles actually has delivered a few production TS units to lucky customers in Europe. So despite the sci-fi look, this thing looks set to become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird may be bankrupt, but shared micromobility is doing just fine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electric Scooter Company Bird Files For Bankruptcy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s28WLxNKdML2PrK7HYSfz3snMzA=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72987279/1870723280.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J31XPi"&gt;On the surface, electric scooter pioneer Bird filing for bankruptcy would seem to be a nail in the coffin for shared micromobility — that nebulous term often used to describe rentable electric bikes and scooters in cities. After a number of mergers and some bad financial management, the OG scooter company is going belly up. That can’t bode well for the future of scooters in general, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plzhHD"&gt;But actually, shared electric mobility is doing just fine. Sure, the margins are tight and profitability is still rare, but shared scooter and bike companies are becoming more integral to city life in ways we never thought possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OG5sw4"&gt;The only thing that’s dead is the zero-interest rate-influenced era of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20895798/bird-scooter-fundraising-valuation-unit-economics"&gt;unhinged investments and wildly skewed valuations&lt;/a&gt; that we saw at the end of the last decade. Hopefully now, with Bird filing for Chapter 11, we will see a new era of more responsible management and better pricing in order to ensure these systems remain viable for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dHrjq0"&gt;The state of the scooter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MBQFNI"&gt;Despite Bird’s murky future, cities are really taking to their shared scooters and bikes. But don’t take my word for it — this is &lt;a href="https://nacto.org/2023/11/02/shared-micromobility-2022/"&gt;according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials’ (NACTO) annual report&lt;/a&gt; on the state of play in 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GMMmEU"&gt;The number of micromobility trips in the U.S. and Canada increased by five million from 2021 and are up by 40% since 2018. In the U.S., shared micromobility continued its pandemic-era recovery, with 113 million trips in 2022, while ridership in Canada blew past pre-pandemic highs, with 17 million trips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2iV3ck"&gt;It’s not just 9-to-5 commuters or even just tourists who are taking all these rides. According to NACTO, 34 percent of riders are using bikes and scooters “to access jobs,” while 39 percent are running errands, 16 percent are going to school, and 50 percent for “other social or recreation trips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YAEg8R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"They said you could leave electric scooters anywhere — then the repo men struck back","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20696405/dockless-scooters-share-repo-men-repossessor-lawsuit-tow-yard-lime-bird-lyft-uber-razor"},{"title":"Bird: careless leadership, high turnover, and inappropriate office behavior","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231802/bird-electric-scooter-company-workplace-culture-layoffs"},{"title":"How the novel coronavirus is speeding the scooter apocalypse","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257307/electric-scooter-bikeshare-covid-19-bird-lime-uber-subsidies"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4XnFf2"&gt;E-bikes, in particular, are becoming more popular, with three-quarters of all station-based systems (docked, as opposed to dockless systems like Bird) in the US and Canada expanding the number of e-bikes in their fleets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Z00Dg"&gt;In the US, shared e-bike trips increased from 14.5 million trips in 2021 to 20 million trips in 2022. And while docked e-bikes made up only 9 percent of the micromobility fleet in the US and Canada in 2022, they accounted for 18 percent of total trips. People love their e-bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snkAvM"&gt;But NACTO’s assessment of the state of scooter trips is not all wine and roses. There are troubling trends on the horizon, “including volatility amongst private-sector operators and climbing costs for riders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ewlga"&gt;This week, we saw one of those predictions play out in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2s9dHm"&gt;It’s not just Bird&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2ewJ6i"&gt;When Bird first began dropping its scooters on the streets of Santa Monica in 2017, the future seemed bright for this new concept of micromobility. Before Bird, we had plenty of so-called docked bikeshare programs, like CitiBike in New York and Divvy Bikes in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUuDtP"&gt;But these scooters were &lt;em&gt;dockless&lt;/em&gt;. They could go everywhere and be left anywhere. And the scooters — off-the-shelf Chinese models from brands like Xiaomi and Segway-Ninebot — were cheap to buy, so Bird could theoretically launch in any city it wanted and start distributing scooters. The only obstacle were cities who had learned a thing or two during the rise of Uber and Lyft and were naturally skeptical of venture capital-based startups claiming to solve the problem with mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vASfeA"&gt;But almost immediately, the financial health of shared micromobility came under scrutiny. An early indicator that the mission of cheap, plentiful electric mobility was in danger was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307591/electric-scooter-sharing-bird-lime-uber-economics-big-picture"&gt;the unit economics of the scooter business&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7xB74E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But these scooters were dockless&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0rthse"&gt;Cheap as they were, the scooters weren’t lasting on the street long enough to recover their initial costs. They were breaking down, largely because the companies weren’t taking into account the absolute beating these things were taking on a daily basis. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/24/18016486/oakland-scooter-meeting-skip-lime-bird-helmet-safety-responsibility"&gt;People were riding them into the ground&lt;/a&gt; and also vandalizing them. Many ended up in lakes or up in trees. A few were set on fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szqsUH"&gt;So after the initial novelty wore off, the next stage was about right-sizing the industry through purpose-built scooters designed for longer life spans. Bigger, heavier, tougher scooters were the name of the game. Scofflaw city launches gave way to permission-seeking and public-private partnerships. Scooters were relegated to a system of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383976/nyc-scooter-permit-selection-lime-bird-veoride"&gt;begging cities to pick them for a limited number of pilot permits&lt;/a&gt;. The companies that were chosen basked in the glow of their newfound purpose; the losers usually folded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHK6hN"&gt;But after all this spending and sorting, the business of renting a scooter hasn’t really gotten any easier. Bird thought going public would give it the boost it needed, so it merged with one of those special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, back when that was the cool thing to do. But it continued to commit unforced errors, losing money, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23457688/bird-revenue-overstated-shared-electric-scooters-audit"&gt;overstating its revenue&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually slowly descending into layoffs and irrelevancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0gSCW"&gt;Other scooter companies have struggled, too. Many have merged with other companies or simply vanished. New technology that seemed poised to fix a lot of the problems with dockless scooters never really caught on. The micromobility industry continues to shift, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948516/revel-ev-moped-share-end-rideshare-charging-cities"&gt;some players abandoning two wheels altogether&lt;/a&gt; in favor of four. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CfNaY0"&gt;Where does this leave Lime?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FvpL9o"&gt;If one company stands to benefit from Bird’s fall, it’s Lime. The San Francisco-based company can now claim to be the biggest micromobility operator in the US. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23864737/lime-profit-h1-2023-scooter-gross-booking-free-cash"&gt;Lime released a limited set of financial figures&lt;/a&gt; (it is still a private company and under no obligation to share most of these numbers) that it claims show its financial future heading in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFBoxJ"&gt;Lime reported gross bookings of $250 million in the first half of the year, a 45 percent increase over the same period last year. It’s also touted an adjusted EBITDA profitability of $27 million — the first time the company has achieved this for the first half of the year and a 45 percent margin increase over last year — and an unadjusted $20.6 million profitability. Still, there’s a lot we don’t know, like revenue and costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNa9I3"&gt;Lime wasn’t the first to offer shared electric scooters for rent, but it may be the last scooter company standing, especially as others merge and the industry continues to consolidate and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7ZNDgU"&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CSWBuK"&gt;NACTO wants to see more taxpayer-funded subsidies, or even outright municipal ownership of fleets, in order to stave off any more bankruptcies. Roads need to be redesigned to prioritize less-polluting modes of transportation. That means more protected bike lanes and other fixes to encourage those inclined to two-wheeled forms of conveyance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObfPec"&gt;A recent positive step is the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-19/us-roadbuilding-bible-gets-update-as-pedestrian-deaths-rise"&gt;updating of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&lt;/a&gt;, the Federal Highway Administration’s 88-year-old rulebook for road building in the US. The long-awaited 11th volume of the book is said to finally address emerging vehicles, like electric bikes and scooters, and will include needed design changes like bike infrastructure and cycle lane design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWD2bV"&gt;But while we wait for those changes, the micromobility industry will continue to scrape by however it can. Bird said it intends to maintain its operations while going through the restructuring process. Though, it’s unclear where this will leave the company’s system of outsourcing its city operations to independent fleet managers. Will the bankruptcy court authorize payments to unsalaried workers? It’s unclear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PVJTg"&gt;Small electric vehicles are just getting started. E-bike sales are continuing to break records. State subsidies are bringing down costs for interested buyers. Shared fleets are a great entry point to personal ownership. Even &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2023-golf-cart-kingdom/"&gt;electric go-karts&lt;/a&gt; are becoming popular in certain towns in the southeast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNNskw"&gt;Bird’s goose may be cooked, but the need for alternatives to polluting cars remains paramount. The federal government is hoping that Tesla and other electric car companies can bail us out of a future marred by climate change. But we need every weapon in our arsenal if we’re going to beat back this existential threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2USC6"&gt;And that includes micromobility. Even the dinkiest, dorkiest electric scooters matter in this fight. &lt;/p&gt;
