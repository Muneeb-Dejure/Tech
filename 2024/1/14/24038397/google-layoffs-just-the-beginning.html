Even during a particularly nasty week of tech layoffs, Google led the way by suddenly cutting over 1,000 people with barely any explanation.\n\nSince 12,000 people were axed a year ago, smaller layoffs have continued to roll through the sprawling conglomerate at a steady clip, creating a feeling of unease. Not all of these prior cuts have been covered publically, such as a roughly 10 percent downsizing of the public policy group in mid November.\n\nThis latest wave of layoffs felt “extremely impersonal,” as one impacted engineering director with 18 years of employment under his belt wrote in a note to colleagues. Still, many saw them coming. “Google culture changed dramatically last year with its first major round of layoffs, and I saw the writing on the wall,” the engineering director wrote in his note, a copy of which was shared with me. “The conflict between ‘uncomfortable culture’ and ‘golden handcuffs’ was becoming intolerable.”\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai has yet to address the layoffs internally. Information about them has been intentionally siloed team by team, with memos from leads saying they are about “flattening our organization,” making “faster decisions,” and increasing “efficiency.” Team-specific town halls are expected to shed more light in the coming days. For now, the bigger picture is blurry.\n\n“Everyone at Google understands that these [cuts] are coming from the top,” one veteran manager told me. “There’s no way this was the decision of a few disconnected orgs in isolation.”\n\nWhile most of the teams that were hit have been reported already, others haven’t, including cuts to the Maps/Geo, shopping, ads product, and trust and safety teams. As spotted by Bloomberg, disclosures filed with the state of California show that there were a handful of vice presidents and about two dozen directors impacted. I can confirm that Spyro Karetsos, Google’s chief compliance officer who reported to global affairs president Kent Walker, is gone. (Danielle Romain, who currently holds the title “VP of trust,” is taking over the role.)\n\nSome of the accompanying restructurings make sense, like moving the Devices and Services group to a functional org structure, with key disciplines like design now working across Pixel, Nest and Fitbit. I wasn’t surprised to see the AR hardware team finally shuttered, given that it has been on life support for a while anyway. It has been clear that the Bard product group would eventually win the internal power struggle with the Assistant org, which saw steep cuts and a bunch of feature deprecations.\n\nEven after last week, no one I talk to at Google is under the illusion that layoffs are over. There are still over 50,000 people working on Google Cloud, which saw rapid headcount growth during the pandemic and has yet to overtake Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure’s market share. The roughly 30,000-person ad sales group is another natural target.\n\nEmployees I’ve talked to agree that a bigger-than-normal wave of departures could also happen in the spring around Google’s annual performance review cycle. The HR department has quietly started letting managers give their reports low ratings without the previously mandated “support check-in” call, which removes some of the red tape previously required to fire people. “That effectively allows me to give zero notice and expedite someone out,” one manager said.\n\nHeading into 2024, Google has plenty of external problems to contend with, from antitrust lawsuits to startups like Perplexity trying to unseat its dominance in search. But given the cultural shift that employees are grappling with, its biggest challenge may still come from within.\n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Er9o6ISYqo0C6pxjw4spD9S4XPw=/0x0:501x500/501x500/filters:focal(251x250:252x251)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25226494/CES.jpg]\n\nUnofficial CES awards\n\nMy colleagues at The Verge have done an amazing job covering all of the gadgets and gizmos at CES this year. If you haven’t already, be sure to also check out their best-in-show roundup. \n\nI spent most of last week ducking in and out of Las Vegas hotels, meeting with companies like Reddit, Pinterest, and Instacart. I also managed to squeeze in a walk-through of the show floor, which feels increasingly less relevant as more of the action moves to suites and ballrooms at the big hotels. (Perhaps the most talked about device of the week, the Rabbit R1, was announced in a ballroom at the Wynn, not the official CES stage.) \n\nThe more times I attend CES, the more fascination I have with the show behind the show. In that spirit, below are my unofficial CES awards:\n\n* Most inescapable buzzword: AI (duh). I couldn’t walk 30 yards in any direction on the show floor without hearing someone say “AI,” and it came up repeatedly in every meeting I had throughout the week. Everyone seems to think that AI will transform their business. They’re just not sure exactly how.\n* Buzziest gadget: The Rabbit R1 stole the show this year, thanks to a slick unveiling and the love people have for the firm that designed it, Teenage Engineering. I’m of the opinion that this current crop of AI wearables/handheld devices will become obsolete when generative AI gets properly woven into our smartphones. Still, I understand the excitement people have for the Rabbit, especially at its $200 price point. Thanks to generative AI, it feels like we’re on the cusp of a big shift in how we interact with computers. I’m just not sure that we’ll need new computers.\n* Who won the show without being there: This goes to Apple, thanks to its announcement on Monday that the Vision Pro will soon begin shipping. The move gave me flashbacks to when the first iPhone was announced during CES. It’s a reminder that the big tech companies have outgrown the need for publicity from trade shows. For CES to grow, it should probably focus more on the most interesting startups and move away from the pay-to-play model. \n* Attraction of the year: This one goes to the Sphere, which apparently charged about $1 million per day (10x more than normal) during CES week to run ads on the outside of the dome. Snap was one of the first companies this year to really take advantage of the venue’s meeting suites, where CEO Evan Spiegel held court to meet with advertisers and partners on Monday. \n* Heaviest presence from Big Tech: Amazon. SVP Steve Boom was onstage to tout a partnership with Mercedes. Meanwhile, the ads division rented a whole floor of the Aria for meetings and threw a packed party at its Jewel Nightclub on Tuesday with a performance by Ludacris. \n* Best networking event: The annual mixer at the Wynn hosted by Rich Greenfield, Joe Marchese, Alex Michael, Jackie Reses, Kevin Mayer, Tom Staggs, and David Birnbaum. I would share more but it was off the record!\n* The party only your boss could attend: MediaLink’s executive dinner at Zouk Nightclub on Tuesday, featuring a performance by Weezer.\n* The most lavish party: Yahoo’s at the Venetian’s Voltaire nightclub on Wednesday, where Method Man sprayed champagne on the crowd during the Wu-Tang Clan’s performance as guests nibbled on wagyu and caviar bites.\n* Best transportation hack: Taking the free Boring Company Tesla Loop between the convention center’s Central and West halls, which is effectively a somewhat inefficient train. A colleague who rode the Loop with some carmaker execs reports that they were very agitated over Tesla’s ability to market itself so outlandishly.\n* The most ridiculous thing I saw on the show floor that I actually liked: This sparkling grille on a Mercedes concept CLA Class.\n* Fastest WiFi on the Las Vegas Strip: The new Fontainebleau resort and casino.\n* Spotted in the wild: Anduril’s Palmer Luckey touring the show floor by himself in his trademark khaki shorts… X CEO Linda Yaccarino defending her boss during a closed-door conversation with Shelly Palmer… Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev having dinner with Josh Topolsky, who is building the company’s new media subsidiary Sherwood, at Catch in the Aria… Eric Schmidt having dinner with an unidentified group at the Wynn’s SW Steakhouse. \n\n---\n\nThe watercooler\n\nNotes on what else is happening in the tech industry:\n\n* Folks at Meta have taken issue with Business Insider’s characterization of Instagram “cutting a level of management.” I suppose that has to do with the use of the word “level,” which implies something slightly different than what is happening. Still, what Instagram did here is noteworthy: per an internal note by co-head of product Max Eulenstein that I’ve seen, the technical product manager role (essentially a PM with more engineering expertise) is being eliminated because there is too much overlap with the broader PM function. The goal is to “improve efficiency,” of course. I’m told the number of impacted roles is less than 100 and everyone will be given the opportunity to interview for another role internally. \n* A tale of two layoffs: Last week, I broke the news of layoffs at Humane and Discord. They couldn’t have been handled more differently. At Discord, ​​CEO Jason Citron was upfront and transparent. Humane CEO Bethany Bongiorno, on the other hand, tried to spin the news and then front-run me with her own post on LinkedIn. (Front-running a story is a play I will tell the Command Line audience you get to make exactly once!) As for her allegation on X that my “narrative” is inaccurate, I’m still waiting for an on the record rebuttal…\n* A lot has happened at OpenAI since my last issue: The custom GPT store launched, though we are still waiting on the revenue sharing details. (If you’re interested in building a GPT, OpenAI published this handy guide.) Also: OpenAI has 260 of its own enterprise customers… The company clearly hopes to pay off The New York Times rather than fight in court… And congrats are in order to Sam Altman, who got married to Oliver Mulherin in an intimate, beachside ceremony.\n\n---\n\nPeople moves\n\nSome interesting job moves I noticed since the last issue:\n\n* This news was awkwardly timed to Linda Yaccarino’s CES meetings: Carrie Stimmel, who she hired to lead agency relationships in September, has already left.\n* Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are leaving Google as part of the layoffs and restructuring last week, which I’ve heard hit the Fitbit team particularly hard. \n* Some AI-themed moves: Microsoft named Dee Templeton, a deputy of CTO Kevin Scott, to fill its nonvoting observer seat on OpenAI’s new board… Ella Irwin, Elon Musk’s last head of trust and safety at X, joined Stability AI as SVP of Integrity… Sebastian Ruder left Google to join Cohere… Sandeep Subramanian left Nvidia to join Mistral… Tesla Dojo team member Clive Chan joined OpenAI… Bill Jia, a veteran Meta engineer leader, joined Google to be VP of engineering for core AI.\n* The return of Parag Agrawal: Twitter’s last CEO before Elon Musk has a new startup. And in other Twitter alumni news: former head of ad sales Sarah Personette is now the CEO of the digital media startup Puck.\n* Al Gore and James Bell have retired from Apple’s board. Meanwhile, Apple finance VP Saori Casey is joining Sonos as CFO.\n* Slack CTO Cal Henderson is leaving and will be replaced by Salesforce cofounder Parker Harris. \n* The COO of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s philanthropy, Josué Estrada, is leaving in March.\n* Oona King, Snap’s former head of diversity and inclusion, is joining Uber in the same role. \n\n---\n\nInteresting links\n\n* My colleague Mia Sato’s excellent deep dive on how Google SEO reshaped the web. This is also one of the coolest story layouts we’ve done at The Verge, which is saying something!\n* The latest dystopian social media trend is tech workers recording the experience of being laid off and posting it to the world.\n* Meeting notes on how Meta plans to integrate Threads with the Fediverse.\n* Gergely Orosz’s deep dive on how changes to US tax code could impact the hiring of software engineers.\n* Bill Gates interviews Sam Altman.\n\n---\n\nI’ll be back later this week with another issue. In the meantime, send me your feedback and tips. Thanks for subscribing.\n"}</script><link rel="preload" as="image"

Even during a particularly nasty week of tech layoffs, Google led the way by suddenly cutting over 1,000 people with barely any explanation.\n\nSince 12,000 people were axed a year ago, smaller layoffs have continued to roll through the sprawling conglomerate at a steady clip, creating a feeling of unease. Not all of these prior cuts have been covered publically, such as a roughly 10 percent downsizing of the public policy group in mid November.\n\nThis latest wave of layoffs felt “extremely impersonal,” as one impacted engineering director with 18 years of employment under his belt wrote in a note to colleagues. Still, many saw them coming. “Google culture changed dramatically last year with its first major round of layoffs, and I saw the writing on the wall,” the engineering director wrote in his note, a copy of which was shared with me. “The conflict between ‘uncomfortable culture’ and ‘golden handcuffs’ was becoming intolerable.”\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai has yet to address the layoffs internally. Information about them has been intentionally siloed team by team, with memos from leads saying they are about “flattening our organization,” making “faster decisions,” and increasing “efficiency.” Team-specific town halls are expected to shed more light in the coming days. For now, the bigger picture is blurry.\n\n“Everyone at Google understands that these [cuts] are coming from the top,” one veteran manager told me. “There’s no way this was the decision of a few disconnected orgs in isolation.”\n\nWhile most of the teams that were hit have been reported already, others haven’t, including cuts to the Maps/Geo, shopping, ads product, and trust and safety teams. As spotted by Bloomberg, disclosures filed with the state of California show that there were a handful of vice presidents and about two dozen directors impacted. I can confirm that Spyro Karetsos, Google’s chief compliance officer who reported to global affairs president Kent Walker, is gone. (Danielle Romain, who currently holds the title “VP of trust,” is taking over the role.)\n\nSome of the accompanying restructurings make sense, like moving the Devices and Services group to a functional org structure, with key disciplines like design now working across Pixel, Nest and Fitbit. I wasn’t surprised to see the AR hardware team finally shuttered, given that it has been on life support for a while anyway. It has been clear that the Bard product group would eventually win the internal power struggle with the Assistant org, which saw steep cuts and a bunch of feature deprecations.\n\nEven after last week, no one I talk to at Google is under the illusion that layoffs are over. There are still over 50,000 people working on Google Cloud, which saw rapid headcount growth during the pandemic and has yet to overtake Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure’s market share. The roughly 30,000-person ad sales group is another natural target.\n\nEmployees I’ve talked to agree that a bigger-than-normal wave of departures could also happen in the spring around Google’s annual performance review cycle. The HR department has quietly started letting managers give their reports low ratings without the previously mandated “support check-in” call, which removes some of the red tape previously required to fire people. “That effectively allows me to give zero notice and expedite someone out,” one manager said.\n\nHeading into 2024, Google has plenty of external problems to contend with, from antitrust lawsuits to startups like Perplexity trying to unseat its dominance in search. But given the cultural shift that employees are grappling with, its biggest challenge may still come from within.\n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Er9o6ISYqo0C6pxjw4spD9S4XPw=/0x0:501x500/501x500/filters:focal(251x250:252x251)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25226494/CES.jpg]\n\nUnofficial CES awards\n\nMy colleagues at The Verge have done an amazing job covering all of the gadgets and gizmos at CES this year. If you haven’t already, be sure to also check out their best-in-show roundup. \n\nI spent most of last week ducking in and out of Las Vegas hotels, meeting with companies like Reddit, Pinterest, and Instacart. I also managed to squeeze in a walk-through of the show floor, which feels increasingly less relevant as more of the action moves to suites and ballrooms at the big hotels. (Perhaps the most talked about device of the week, the Rabbit R1, was announced in a ballroom at the Wynn, not the official CES stage.) \n\nThe more times I attend CES, the more fascination I have with the show behind the show. In that spirit, below are my unofficial CES awards:\n\n* Most inescapable buzzword: AI (duh). I couldn’t walk 30 yards in any direction on the show floor without hearing someone say “AI,” and it came up repeatedly in every meeting I had throughout the week. Everyone seems to think that AI will transform their business. They’re just not sure exactly how.\n* Buzziest gadget: The Rabbit R1 stole the show this year, thanks to a slick unveiling and the love people have for the firm that designed it, Teenage Engineering. I’m of the opinion that this current crop of AI wearables/handheld devices will become obsolete when generative AI gets properly woven into our smartphones. Still, I understand the excitement people have for the Rabbit, especially at its $200 price point. Thanks to generative AI, it feels like we’re on the cusp of a big shift in how we interact with computers. I’m just not sure that we’ll need new computers.\n* Who won the show without being there: This goes to Apple, thanks to its announcement on Monday that the Vision Pro will soon begin shipping. The move gave me flashbacks to when the first iPhone was announced during CES. It’s a reminder that the big tech companies have outgrown the need for publicity from trade shows. For CES to grow, it should probably focus more on the most interesting startups and move away from the pay-to-play model. \n* Attraction of the year: This one goes to the Sphere, which apparently charged about $1 million per day (10x more than normal) during CES week to run ads on the outside of the dome. Snap was one of the first companies this year to really take advantage of the venue’s meeting suites, where CEO Evan Spiegel held court to meet with advertisers and partners on Monday. \n* Heaviest presence from Big Tech: Amazon. SVP Steve Boom was onstage to tout a partnership with Mercedes. Meanwhile, the ads division rented a whole floor of the Aria for meetings and threw a packed party at its Jewel Nightclub on Tuesday with a performance by Ludacris. \n* Best networking event: The annual mixer at the Wynn hosted by Rich Greenfield, Joe Marchese, Alex Michael, Jackie Reses, Kevin Mayer, Tom Staggs, and David Birnbaum. I would share more but it was off the record!\n* The party only your boss could attend: MediaLink’s executive dinner at Zouk Nightclub on Tuesday, featuring a performance by Weezer.\n* The most lavish party: Yahoo’s at the Venetian’s Voltaire nightclub on Wednesday, where Method Man sprayed champagne on the crowd during the Wu-Tang Clan’s performance as guests nibbled on wagyu and caviar bites.\n* Best transportation hack: Taking the free Boring Company Tesla Loop between the convention center’s Central and West halls, which is effectively a somewhat inefficient train. A colleague who rode the Loop with some carmaker execs reports that they were very agitated over Tesla’s ability to market itself so outlandishly.\n* The most ridiculous thing I saw on the show floor that I actually liked: This sparkling grille on a Mercedes concept CLA Class.\n* Fastest WiFi on the Las Vegas Strip: The new Fontainebleau resort and casino.\n* Spotted in the wild: Anduril’s Palmer Luckey touring the show floor by himself in his trademark khaki shorts… X CEO Linda Yaccarino defending her boss during a closed-door conversation with Shelly Palmer… Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev having dinner with Josh Topolsky, who is building the company’s new media subsidiary Sherwood, at Catch in the Aria… Eric Schmidt having dinner with an unidentified group at the Wynn’s SW Steakhouse. \n\n---\n\nThe watercooler\n\nNotes on what else is happening in the tech industry:\n\n* Folks at Meta have taken issue with Business Insider’s characterization of Instagram “cutting a level of management.” I suppose that has to do with the use of the word “level,” which implies something slightly different than what is happening. Still, what Instagram did here is noteworthy: per an internal note by co-head of product Max Eulenstein that I’ve seen, the technical product manager role (essentially a PM with more engineering expertise) is being eliminated because there is too much overlap with the broader PM function. The goal is to “improve efficiency,” of course. I’m told the number of impacted roles is less than 100 and everyone will be given the opportunity to interview for another role internally. \n* A tale of two layoffs: Last week, I broke the news of layoffs at Humane and Discord. They couldn’t have been handled more differently. At Discord, ​​CEO Jason Citron was upfront and transparent. Humane CEO Bethany Bongiorno, on the other hand, tried to spin the news and then front-run me with her own post on LinkedIn. (Front-running a story is a play I will tell the Command Line audience you get to make exactly once!) As for her allegation on X that my “narrative” is inaccurate, I’m still waiting for an on the record rebuttal…\n* A lot has happened at OpenAI since my last issue: The custom GPT store launched, though we are still waiting on the revenue sharing details. (If you’re interested in building a GPT, OpenAI published this handy guide.) Also: OpenAI has 260 of its own enterprise customers… The company clearly hopes to pay off The New York Times rather than fight in court… And congrats are in order to Sam Altman, who got married to Oliver Mulherin in an intimate, beachside ceremony.\n\n---\n\nPeople moves\n\nSome interesting job moves I noticed since the last issue:\n\n* This news was awkwardly timed to Linda Yaccarino’s CES meetings: Carrie Stimmel, who she hired to lead agency relationships in September, has already left.\n* Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are leaving Google as part of the layoffs and restructuring last week, which I’ve heard hit the Fitbit team particularly hard. \n* Some AI-themed moves: Microsoft named Dee Templeton, a deputy of CTO Kevin Scott, to fill its nonvoting observer seat on OpenAI’s new board… Ella Irwin, Elon Musk’s last head of trust and safety at X, joined Stability AI as SVP of Integrity… Sebastian Ruder left Google to join Cohere… Sandeep Subramanian left Nvidia to join Mistral… Tesla Dojo team member Clive Chan joined OpenAI… Bill Jia, a veteran Meta engineer leader, joined Google to be VP of engineering for core AI.\n* The return of Parag Agrawal: Twitter’s last CEO before Elon Musk has a new startup. And in other Twitter alumni news: former head of ad sales Sarah Personette is now the CEO of the digital media startup Puck.\n* Al Gore and James Bell have retired from Apple’s board. Meanwhile, Apple finance VP Saori Casey is joining Sonos as CFO.\n* Slack CTO Cal Henderson is leaving and will be replaced by Salesforce cofounder Parker Harris. \n* The COO of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s philanthropy, Josué Estrada, is leaving in March.\n* Oona King, Snap’s former head of diversity and inclusion, is joining Uber in the same role. \n\n---\n\nInteresting links\n\n* My colleague Mia Sato’s excellent deep dive on how Google SEO reshaped the web. This is also one of the coolest story layouts we’ve done at The Verge, which is saying something!\n* The latest dystopian social media trend is tech workers recording the experience of being laid off and posting it to the world.\n* Meeting notes on how Meta plans to integrate Threads with the Fediverse.\n* Gergely Orosz’s deep dive on how changes to US tax code could impact the hiring of software engineers.\n* Bill Gates interviews Sam Altman.\n\n---\n\nI’ll be back later this week with another issue.

It has been clear that the Bard product group would eventually win the internal power struggle with the Assistant org, which saw steep cuts and a bunch of feature deprecations.\n\nEven after last week, no one I talk to at Google is under the illusion that layoffs are over. There are still over 50,000 people working on Google Cloud, which saw rapid headcount growth during the pandemic and has yet to overtake Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure’s market share. The roughly 30,000-person ad sales group is another natural target.\n\nEmployees I’ve talked to agree that a bigger-than-normal wave of departures could also happen in the spring around Google’s annual performance review cycle. The HR department has quietly started letting managers give their reports low ratings without the previously mandated “support check-in” call, which removes some of the red tape previously required to fire people. “That effectively allows me to give zero notice and expedite someone out,” one manager said.\n\nHeading into 2024, Google has plenty of external problems to contend with, from antitrust lawsuits to startups like Perplexity trying to unseat its dominance in search. But given the cultural shift that employees are grappling with, its biggest challenge may still come from within.\n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Er9o6ISYqo0C6pxjw4spD9S4XPw=/0x0:501x500/501x500/filters:focal(251x250:252x251)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25226494/CES.jpg]\n\nUnofficial CES awards\n\nMy colleagues at The Verge have done an amazing job covering all of the gadgets and gizmos at CES this year. If you haven’t already, be sure to also check out their best-in-show roundup. \n\nI spent most of last week ducking in and out of Las Vegas hotels, meeting with companies like Reddit, Pinterest, and Instacart. I also managed to squeeze in a walk-through of the show floor, which feels increasingly less relevant as more of the action moves to suites and ballrooms at the big hotels. (Perhaps the most talked about device of the week, the Rabbit R1, was announced in a ballroom at the Wynn, not the official CES stage.) \n\nThe more times I attend CES, the more fascination I have with the show behind the show. In that spirit, below are my unofficial CES awards:\n\n* Most inescapable buzzword: AI (duh). I couldn’t walk 30 yards in any direction on the show floor without hearing someone say “AI,” and it came up repeatedly in every meeting I had throughout the week. Everyone seems to think that AI will transform their business. They’re just not sure exactly how.\n* Buzziest gadget: The Rabbit R1 stole the show this year, thanks to a slick unveiling and the love people have for the firm that designed it, Teenage Engineering. I’m of the opinion that this current crop of AI wearables/handheld devices will become obsolete when generative AI gets properly woven into our smartphones. Still, I understand the excitement people have for the Rabbit, especially at its $200 price point. Thanks to generative AI, it feels like we’re on the cusp of a big shift in how we interact with computers. I’m just not sure that we’ll need new computers.\n* Who won the show without being there: This goes to Apple, thanks to its announcement on Monday that the Vision Pro will soon begin shipping. The move gave me flashbacks to when the first iPhone was announced during CES. It’s a reminder that the big tech companies have outgrown the need for publicity from trade shows. For CES to grow, it should probably focus more on the most interesting startups and move away from the pay-to-play model. \n* Attraction of the year: This one goes to the Sphere, which apparently charged about $1 million per day (10x more than normal) during CES week to run ads on the outside of the dome. Snap was one of the first companies this year to really take advantage of the venue’s meeting suites, where CEO Evan Spiegel held court to meet with advertisers and partners on Monday. \n* Heaviest presence from Big Tech: Amazon. SVP Steve Boom was onstage to tout a partnership with Mercedes. Meanwhile, the ads division rented a whole floor of the Aria for meetings and threw a packed party at its Jewel Nightclub on Tuesday with a performance by Ludacris. \n* Best networking event: The annual mixer at the Wynn hosted by Rich Greenfield, Joe Marchese, Alex Michael, Jackie Reses, Kevin Mayer, Tom Staggs, and David Birnbaum. I would share more but it was off the record!\n* The party only your boss could attend: MediaLink’s executive dinner at Zouk Nightclub on Tuesday, featuring a performance by Weezer.\n* The most lavish party: Yahoo’s at the Venetian’s Voltaire nightclub on Wednesday, where Method Man sprayed champagne on the crowd during the Wu-Tang Clan’s performance as guests nibbled on wagyu and caviar bites.\n* Best transportation hack: Taking the free Boring Company Tesla Loop between the convention center’s Central and West halls, which is effectively a somewhat inefficient train. A colleague who rode the Loop with some carmaker execs reports that they were very agitated over Tesla’s ability to market itself so outlandishly.\n* The most ridiculous thing I saw on the show floor that I actually liked: This sparkling grille on a Mercedes concept CLA Class.\n* Fastest WiFi on the Las Vegas Strip: The new Fontainebleau resort and casino.\n* Spotted in the wild: Anduril’s Palmer Luckey touring the show floor by himself in his trademark khaki shorts… X CEO Linda Yaccarino defending her boss during a closed-door conversation with Shelly Palmer… Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev having dinner with Josh Topolsky, who is building the company’s new media subsidiary Sherwood, at Catch in the Aria… Eric Schmidt having dinner with an unidentified group at the Wynn’s SW Steakhouse. \n\n---\n\nThe watercooler\n\nNotes on what else is happening in the tech industry:\n\n* Folks at Meta have taken issue with Business Insider’s characterization of Instagram “cutting a level of management.” I suppose that has to do with the use of the word “level,” which implies something slightly different than what is happening. Still, what Instagram did here is noteworthy: per an internal note by co-head of product Max Eulenstein that I’ve seen, the technical product manager role (essentially a PM with more engineering expertise) is being eliminated because there is too much overlap with the broader PM function. The goal is to “improve efficiency,” of course. I’m told the number of impacted roles is less than 100 and everyone will be given the opportunity to interview for another role internally. \n* A tale of two layoffs: Last week, I broke the news of layoffs at Humane and Discord. They couldn’t have been handled more differently. At Discord, ​​CEO Jason Citron was upfront and transparent. Humane CEO Bethany Bongiorno, on the other hand, tried to spin the news and then front-run me with her own post on LinkedIn. (Front-running a story is a play I will tell the Command Line audience you get to make exactly once!) As for her allegation on X that my “narrative” is inaccurate, I’m still waiting for an on the record rebuttal…\n* A lot has happened at OpenAI since my last issue: The custom GPT store launched, though we are still waiting on the revenue sharing details. (If you’re interested in building a GPT, OpenAI published this handy guide.) Also: OpenAI has 260 of its own enterprise customers… The company clearly hopes to pay off The New York Times rather than fight in court… And congrats are in order to Sam Altman, who got married to Oliver Mulherin in an intimate, beachside ceremony.\n\n---\n\nPeople moves\n\nSome interesting job moves I noticed since the last issue:\n\n* This news was awkwardly timed to Linda Yaccarino’s CES meetings: Carrie Stimmel, who she hired to lead agency relationships in September, has already left.\n* Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are leaving Google as part of the layoffs and restructuring last week, which I’ve heard hit the Fitbit team particularly hard. \n* Some AI-themed moves: Microsoft named Dee Templeton, a deputy of CTO Kevin Scott, to fill its nonvoting observer seat on OpenAI’s new board… Ella Irwin, Elon Musk’s last head of trust and safety at X, joined Stability AI as SVP of Integrity… Sebastian Ruder left Google to join Cohere… Sandeep Subramanian left Nvidia to join Mistral… Tesla Dojo team member Clive Chan joined OpenAI… Bill Jia, a veteran Meta engineer leader, joined Google to be VP of engineering for core AI.\n* The return of Parag Agrawal: Twitter’s last CEO before Elon Musk has a new startup. And in other Twitter alumni news: former head of ad sales Sarah Personette is now the CEO of the digital media startup Puck.\n* Al Gore and James Bell have retired from Apple’s board. Meanwhile, Apple finance VP Saori Casey is joining Sonos as CFO.\n* Slack CTO Cal Henderson is leaving and will be replaced by Salesforce cofounder Parker Harris. \n* The COO of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s philanthropy, Josué Estrada, is leaving in March.\n* Oona King, Snap’s former head of diversity and inclusion, is joining Uber in the same role. \n\n---\n\nInteresting links\n\n* My colleague Mia Sato’s excellent deep dive on how Google SEO reshaped the web. This is also one of the coolest story layouts we’ve done at The Verge, which is saying something!\n* The latest dystopian social media trend is tech workers recording the experience of being laid off and posting it to the world.\n* Meeting notes on how Meta plans to integrate Threads with the Fediverse.\n* Gergely Orosz’s deep dive on how changes to US tax code could impact the hiring of software engineers.\n* Bill Gates interviews Sam Altman.\n\n---\n\nI’ll be back later this week with another issue. In the meantime, send me your feedback and tips.
