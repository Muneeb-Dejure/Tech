Adam Mosseri explains why the platform wants to take on Twitter. “Obviously, Twitter pioneered the space,” Mosseri says. “And there are a lot of good offerings out there for public conversations.

Instagram.”</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component clear-both block"><div class="duet--media--embed min-h-[500px] [&amp;&gt;div&gt;iframe]:!min-w-0 mb-20 w-full"></div></div><div

updates.” In June, Alex Heath leaked the details of a companywide meeting where the app was shown off and <a href="/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub">shared the

care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow.” The app is closely tied to Instagram, meaning you’ll get to use the same username across both apps as well as quickly follow all of the accounts you’ve been following on Instagram. </p></div></div><div class="mx-[-16px] border-y-2 border-y-blurple-df px-16 py-18 md:mx-0 md:border-2 md:border-blurple-df md:pr-60"><div class="relative"><div

The launch follows the service’s <a href="/2023/7/5/23784263/instagram-threads-app-download-iphone-android">debut in the US and over 100 other countries</a> across the world, including the UK, in July 2023. But until now, Threads hasn’t been available to the 448 million people living in the EU, and the company has even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/14/meta-is-blocking-eu-based-users-from-accessing-threads-via-vpn/">blocked EU-based users from accessing the service via VPN</a>.</p></div><div class="duet--article--article-body-component"><p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph my-12 font-fkroman text-17 leading-150 text-gray-13 selection:bg-franklin-20 dark:text-white dark:selection:bg-blurple [&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-franklin dark:[&amp;_a:hover]:shadow-highlight-blurple [&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-black dark:[&amp;_a]:shadow-underline-white">To coincide with today’s launch, Meta is giving users in the region the ability to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/#:~:text=Update%20on%20December%2014%2C%202023%20at%203%3A05AM%20PT%3A">browse Threads without needing a profile</a>.

Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="/2023/7/5/23784870/instagram-threads-adam-mosseri-interview-twitter-competitor">told <em>The Verge </em>in July</a> that he believed decentralizing the platform was key to making it relevant to a new generation of creators. “I think we might be a more compelling platform for creators, particularly for the newer creators who are more and more savvy, if we are a place where you don’t have to feel like you have to trust us forever,” he said at the time.</p></div><span class="mb-8 font-polysans text-15 font-medium leading-150 tracking-1 text-gray-13 "><a

I know this. God knows this. I am going to limit my analysis to text-based sites because video sites such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram are not my ministry. This analysis may transfer in whole or in part to those platforms, for all I know. \n\nThe silent majority of every successful text-based social media site is lurkers. These are sane, normal people with sane, normal lives. They are well-balanced and have hobbies. One of those hobbies is visiting social media sites, where they are usually looking for either information or entertainment. They’re the audience.\n\n\"The development of trolls appears to be the internet’s version of carcinization\"\n\nOf the remaining minority, there are several classes of user: the influencer, the commenter, the reply guy, and the poster. We’ll take them in turns.\n\n* The influencer is building a business. They are making #content. They are doing at least one of the following: posting for social capital, getting paid out by the social media site directly, or getting paid by sponsors for their posts. They are valuable in that they push internet commerce, but they are also usually operating within the bounds of safety, for fear of alienating sponsors.\n* The commenter is trying to have a conversation with another human being. They are hoping, however misguidedly, to have a meaningful interaction online. Perhaps it is because they are going through an isolated period in their lives; perhaps it is because they have an esoteric interest unshared by those in their IRL orbit. Perhaps they have been stirred somewhere in the depths of their soul — or maybe they’re just bored at work. The lesser trolls, who have nothing nice to say, ever, and live to annoy other commenters, are a notable subclass.\n* The reply guy can be thought of as the most important subclass of commenter; they are specific. They are usually interacting with or on behalf of a favored internet user. Muting a reply guy will not make them go away. Interacting in any way will only encourage them to continue replying. Their motivations are wholly unclear to me, but they are an important part of virtually every internet ecosystem; there is a school of thought that this behavior is a reflection of parasocial relationships. With that in mind, and after great deliberation, I have placed stans here as notable clade of reply guy.\n* Finally, we have the poster, sometimes referred to as a poaster. The poster is required for every social network to function. Their lack of inhibition is part of what makes social media entertaining. They are the oversharers. They are the Types of Guy. They have thoughts about what is problematique. They are Engaged in the Discourse. Greater trolls, the ones who post bait or otherwise deliberately kick off flame wars that consume entire platforms, are a subclass of posters who’ve lost the mandate of heaven. (The development of trolls appears to be the internet’s version of carcinization.)\n\nI have come to believe that any social media platform that dips under 10 percent poster will fail, but as the early days of Bluesky demonstrated, if you over index on posters, you will have endless fucking chaos. It is possible that posters are deeply unwell. Certainly they are far too online.\n\nComes now Threads, Adam Mosseri’s attempt to keep Instagram relevant. Here’s my guy:\n\n[Media: https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C2xieeovAIA/?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D]\n\nThe features that are being requested are features for influencers and posters, the power users. An edit button allows for correcting captions and also trolling. A following feed and trending section builds Discourse, as do hashtags. The argument for building these features for your power users is that the power users are what everyone else is there for. Growth is the second-order effect.\n\nThe successful social media network is an aquarium. The influencers and posters are the denizens — jellyfish, filter feeders, sharks, octopuses, rays, squid, clownfish, and so on. The lurkers are the visitors, marveling at the shape and color of the aquarium’s denizens. Trying to make the aquarium actually functional is an impossible task; better to simply adopt an attitude of slim-pickens-riding-the-atom-bomb.gif.\n\nGenerally speaking, posters generate Discourse; reply guys and commenters continue and refine it; finally, influencers and Brands capitalize on it. It is possible, though rare, for reply guys, commenters, and influencers to generate Discourse, but the point is: someone has to kick it off and usually that someone is the person with the least inhibitions.\n\nThe friendliest of the influencers and posters are over in the petting zoo section, where commenters and reply guys can reach into the water and touch them. The less friendly ones occasionally smash through the glass to take someone out; put in the same tank, they may consume each other. This sort of thing tends to draw visitors — who doesn’t want to be in the splash zone when the shark gets fed?\n\n\"Will this be useful or even entertaining to my readers?\"\n\nTwitter grew using celebrities and journalists — two of the more exotic clades of poster, prone to entertaining fights and bizarre output. Part of its original draw was that it was up-to-the-minute coverage of what was going on; if you thought you felt an earthquake in San Francisco, you could search Twitter and discover people posting “earthquake?”\n\nThat aquarium was already unbalanced and leaking users when Elon Musk took it over and renamed it X. Musk further skewed the ecosystem by alienating posters and promoting an overgrowth of influencers and reply guys via his blue check system. The people who are likeliest to purchase a blue check for priority in feeds are those with something to sell. The next-likeliest are people who want to make really sure you see their reply.\n\nThreads is also unbalanced as an ecosystem, skewed toward Brands, a particularly noxious infraclass of influencer that is nonetheless profitable for the network. But for Threads to be valuable to Brands — more valuable than, say, TikTok — there needs to be a strong base of lurkers. Most lurkers will tolerate Brands, but Brands themselves aren’t a draw. They’re just the gift shop at the aquarium. \n\nI am grateful to Mosseri, who has given me the opportunity to finally expound on a taxonomy of users I have been cobbling together for months. I do not operate under the delusion that this will sway his decision-making, or that he will even read this. Will this be useful or even entertaining to my readers? I have no idea. Why am I writing this at all? No one knows what motivates a poster, least of all me.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Threads is working on its version of trending topics.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2024-01-30T01:08:00.864Z","dateModified":"2024-01-30T01:08:00.864Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/29/24055175/threads-is-working-on-its-version-of-trending-topics","author":[],"articleBody":"Instagram head Adam Mosseri confirmed in a post today that the Threads team is working on “surfacing trends”, so that new feature is definitely on the way. \n\nLast month, leaker Alessandro Paluzzi posted a screenshot of a feature entitled “Today’s topics” that seems similar to X’s “Trending Topics”, which display topics that users are engaging with the most.

Right now, it’s possible to follow a few Threads accounts (including Mosseri’s) from other platforms, but Meta has much bigger plans for Threads interoperability that Mosseri says will take “the better part of a year” to realize.\n\nHere’s what’s in the works, according to Mosseri.\n\n* Mosseri says that the Threads team wants to make it so the option to follow a Threads account on other platforms is available to “all public accounts on Threads, not just a handful of testers.” \n* At the moment, he says the team plans to require accounts to be public and that users “explicitly opt in” to showing their posts on other federated servers. But the team is still considering making this the default, with the choice to opt out, instead.\n* The Threads team wants to let replies from other platforms show up inside of Threads. “It’s a bad experience now that I have to leave the Threads app to see replies I’m getting from the broader community,” Mosseri says.\n* Threads is planning to support the ability to follow non-Threads fediverse accounts. “There’s a fair amount to figure out with regards to privacy and integrity, but we’re actively working through those issues,” according to Mosseri.\n* This is a key one: follower portability. “Eventually, it should also be possible to enable creators to leave Threads and take their followers with them to another app / server,” Mosseri writes. “I believe that it’s important that creators own their relationship with their audience.”\n\nMosseri says the updates will roll out “in stages,” and he recognizes that the “better part of a year” timeline is a long one. “That’s a lot longer than I, or anybody on the team, wants, but it’s the reality given all the other work we need to be balance,” he says. Still, I’m encouraged by what we’ve already seen from the initial ActivityPub tests. I’ve watched a Threads video from Mosseri on Mastodon, that rules! \n\nHere is a gallery of the full thread.\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_VCRAITUawxBHwAt70klRGpIZM=/0x0:1110x1577/1110x1577/filters:focal(555x789:556x790)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25166628/IMG_3978.jpeg]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VOp-YooCB3ucBDRLvPAQYNT6I88=/0x0:1113x1704/1113x1704/filters:focal(557x852:558x853)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25166631/IMG_3982.PNG]\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4hkVq0rgC4RJTG7kbNR9RazsvPE=/0x0:1109x495/1109x495/filters:focal(555x248:556x249)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25166626/IMG_3980.jpeg]\n\nUpdate December 15th, 5:57PM ET: Added screenshots of Mosseri’s thread.\n\nUpdate December 16th, 8:31AM ET: Added more details posted by Mosseri.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"A Threads post on Mastodon!","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-12-14T17:12:35.874Z","dateModified":"2023-12-14T17:12:35.874Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/14/24001421/a-threads-post-on-mastodon","author":[],"articleBody":"I’m seeing Adam Mosseri’s new Threads video when I look at his Threads account via mastodon.social on the web.

The launch follows the service’s debut in the US and over 100 other countries across the world, including the UK, in July 2023. But until now, Threads hasn’t been available to the 448 million people living in the EU, and the company has even blocked EU-based users from accessing the service via VPN.\n\nTo coincide with today’s launch, Meta is giving users in the region the ability to browse Threads without needing a profile. Actually posting or interacting with content will still require an Instagram account, however. The move was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n[Image: The choice given to EU users. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uXcnNDr_ZVmegQ1w59yr4VN9NZM=/0x0:1056x704/1056x704/filters:focal(528x352:529x353)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25162182/image__22_.jpg]\n[Image: The conditions of using Threads without a profile. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ps60fVHt8aEMTIY7m5s3RlHUk28=/0x0:2202x1468/2202x1468/filters:focal(1101x734:1102x735)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25162177/image__21_.jpg]\n\nThe company’s delay in launching the service in EU countries has been widely blamed on the bloc’s recent introduction of the Digital Markets Act, a sweeping piece of legislation that’s designed to rein in Big Tech abuses and level the playing field. Although Meta hasn’t named the regulation directly, Instagram head Adam Mosseri blamed the delay on “the complexities with complying with some of the laws coming into effect next year.” Companies like Meta, designated as “gatekeepers” under the DMA, have until March 2024 to comply with its requirements.\n\nThere’s been speculation that Threads’ tight integration with Instagram could create problems with EU regulators. When it launched in July 2023, users signed up via their existing Instagram accounts and could quickly connect with all of the Instagram users they followed. This reduced friction helped Threads quickly amass 100 million users in a matter of days but raised concerns that Meta could run afoul of the DMA’s rules against self-preferencing.\n\n[Media: https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C01LXhDrCAM]\n\nThreads today isn’t quite as tightly intwined with Instagram as it was at launch. In mid-November, the platform added the ability for users to delete their Threads account without also having to delete their Instagram account. But links between the services remain; you still need an Instagram account to post on the service.\n\nWhile Threads caught on quickly, partly thanks to piggybacking off the popularity of Instagram and partly capitalizing on the chaos at Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter), third-party data has suggested that Meta’s platform has struggled to retain users after its initial surge. Its EU launch will almost certainly bring a spike of new users; the question is whether Threads has evolved and added enough new features since launch to hold onto them.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Threads really is joining the Fediverse.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-12-14T03:22:45.715Z","dateModified":"2023-12-14T03:22:45.715Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/24000842/threads-really-is-joining-the-fediverse","author":[],"articleBody":"A Threads user, Kevin Beaumont, shared screenshots of Adam Mosseri’s account on the Mastodon client Ivory, and on Mastodon, Beaumont shared screenshots of following Mosseri’s Threads account from his Mastodon account.

Zuckerberg wrote that making Threads work with the interoperable standard “will give people more choice over how they interact and it will help content reach more people.”\n\nJoining the fediverse — the decentralized world of social media that includes Mastodon, Pixelfed, and other services that all interoperate through ActivityPub — has been on the Threads team’s to-do list since the very beginning. Instagram head Adam Mosseri told The Verge in July that he believed decentralizing the platform was key to making it relevant to a new generation of creators. “I think we might be a more compelling platform for creators, particularly for the newer creators who are more and more savvy, if we are a place where you don’t have to feel like you have to trust us forever,” he said at the time.\n\nZuckerberg echoed the sentiment this fall, telling The Verge’s Alex Heath that “my view is that the more that there’s interoperability between different services and the more content can flow, the better all the services can be.” In August, Threads made it possible to verify your account through Mastodon, which isn’t exactly a decentralization feature but was at least a sign of goodwill toward the fediverse.\n\nSkeptics have long held that Threads would never actually federate, even as Zuckerberg, Mosseri, and others at Meta kept promising they would. For the largest and most centralized social service on the web, suddenly throwing open the gates to other platforms seemed like an unlikely pivot. And as Threads got bigger and more mature, ActivityPub integration became a bigger project — and as the platform became more successful, there were more reasons for Meta to try to back off its decentralization plans. But it appears the company might actually do it.\n\nThis test appears to only cover one small part of a truly federated social network — it doesn’t sound like you’ll be able to post from Mastodon to Threads, for instance, and you can’t move your account between services. But the test at least reaffirms Meta’s commitment to ActivityPub and to being part of the broader open social web.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Meta wants to “extend” its fact-checking program for Threads in 2024.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-12-12T21:20:13.689Z","dateModified":"2023-12-12T21:20:13.689Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23998948/meta-wants-to-extend-its-fact-checking-program-for-threads-in-2024","author":[],"articleBody":"Threads currently matches the fact-check ratings from Facebook and Instagram, but “our goal is for fact-checking partners to have the ability to review and rate misinformation on the app,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in a post on Threads.\n\nImproving fact-checking tools could make Threads a more attractive place for publishers.

When composing a Threads post, you start a tag by tapping the # symbol and then typing out your topic. But instead of being limited to just one word, you can type out a whole phrase (with spaces!) and add special characters, according to Mosseri. However, you can only make one tag per post.\n\n[Media: https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C0j585AvsJq]\n\nThe purpose of tags on Threads is the same as a hashtag, though. “If you share on Threads, [tags are] a great way to help connect with people who are interested in the topics you’re talking about,” Mosseri says. “And for everyone, it’s a great way to help dive deeper into your interests.” \n\nI like Meta’s implementation here, even the single-tag limit, as it seems like a smart way to prevent annoying hashtag spam. That said, we’ll have to wait and see if users actually adopt the tags so that they can become a useful way to find conversations about a topic. (I’m hoping there will be some tags about The Game Awards when I cover that event tonight.)\n\nMeta first started testing tags with users in Australia in November. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Joe Biden’s birthday gift to himself is a Threads account","alternativeHeadline":"The President, Vice President, and the White House all signed up for Threads today, but said the move isn’t related to X.","datePublished":"2023-11-20T23:21:33.000Z","dateModified":"2023-11-20T23:21:33.000Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23969994/president-joe-biden-threads-account","author":[],"articleBody":"US President Joe Biden signed up for a Threads account today, as did the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris, and the second gentleman, Douglas Emhoff. \n\nBiden’s first post on Meta’s X (formerly Twitter) competitor harkens back to his 2020 presidential victory speech with references to the country’s divisions and its current “inflection point.” Harris gestured to her travels throughout the US and her having met “over 100” world leaders, and Emhoff wrote about gender equity and “countering hate of all kinds.” \n\n[Media: https://www.threads.net/@potus/post/Cz4g59Ur92-]\n\nMeanwhile, the White House wrote, “The wait is Joe-ver.” Yes, I suppose it is.

But Threads, with its nearly 100 million monthly active users, is a particularly green pasture compared to Mastodon, Bluesky, and all the other X alternatives that have come along recently.\n\nBesides whether and how Threads might introduce an API, it’s an open question whether and how the platform will tackle integration with the open social media protocol ActivityPub.

It’s even made a small step in that direction, making it possible to verify your Threads profile in the so-called fediverse. If it really starts supporting ActivityPub, you could start seeing Threads posts in a fediverse feed that also includes posts from Mastodon, Reddit alternative Lemmy, and any other platform that runs on the protocol. \n\nWe’ve reached out to Meta to find out if it has anything more to say about the possibilities for an API, and we’ll update here if we receive a response.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Meta is testing view counts and pinned posts on Threads.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-10-26T23:07:36.772Z","dateModified":"2023-10-26T23:07:36.772Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23934138/meta-is-testing-view-counts-and-pinned-posts-on-threads","author":[],"articleBody":"The view counts are interesting to me, especially given that the platform formerly known as Twitter launched them in late 2022. “View counts are interesting as I think if we were shipping Instagram, or Facebook, today, we would probably have them,” Mosseri added. “They give people a better sense of their reach, and generally more feedback is a good thing.”\n\nMeta announced the rollout of polls and GIFs on Threads earlier on Thursday.\n\n[Attachment: undefined]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Threads is adding polls and GIFs as it continues to chase X","alternativeHeadline":"Meta is also testing pinned posts and view counts, which you might also be familiar with from the platform formerly known as Twitter.","datePublished":"2023-10-26T17:22:08.426Z","dateModified":"2023-10-26T23:06:30.487Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933559/threads-polls-gifs-app","author":[],"articleBody":"Meta is going to let you make polls and insert GIFs right from the Threads post composer, the company announced on Thursday. Later in the day, Instagram head Adam Mosseri revealed that the company is testing view counts on Threads posts and pinned posts on profiles and in your replies.\n\nThe polls and GIFs features are now rolling out, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated by making a post with a GIF and another post with a poll. They’re small additions, but they’re features you have been able to do on X (formerly Twitter) for a very long time.\n\nZuckerberg’s poll has three options (you can include up to four) and a timer that counts down how long users have to vote in the poll in real time, which is a nice touch. To be able to see the results of the poll, you’ll have to vote in it. If you do vote, Threads will send you a notification when the poll concludes.\n\nTo more easily share GIFs, you’ll be able to select a new GIF icon to search for GIFs from Giphy. The picker will show GIFs that are trending, or you can use the search bar to track down a specific GIF.\n\n[Image: GIF selection screen in the Threads iOS app. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXEoInMpBSZ7m0DjHiFOruND3N4=/0x0:8527x4166/8527x4166/filters:focal(4264x2083:4265x2084)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035317/threads_Gifs_Asset.jpg]\n\n[Image: Creating a poll on Threads. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hr-SyAozAiahKn-7OfK2vY9rlDU=/0x0:1200x607/1200x607/filters:focal(600x304:601x305)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25035323/threads_Polls_Asset.jpg]\n\nThe new Threads tests are also features you might be familiar with from X. X launched view counts for all users in December, and Mosseri seems like a fan of the concept. “View counts are interesting as I think if we were shipping Instagram, or Facebook, today, we would probably have them,” he wrote on Thursday. “They give people a better sense of their reach, and generally more feedback is a good thing.”\n\nPinned posts are a staple of X profiles, but Threads is innovating on the idea by letting you pin a reply to a post. Mosseri says both the view counts and pins tests are “live now for a small number of people.”\n\nThreads launched in July, and Meta has been pleased with the progress; on Wednesday’s earnings call, Zuckerberg revealed that the app already has “just under” 100 million monthly active users.\n\nUpdate October 26th, 7:06PM ET: Added details about new Threads tests.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Meta’s Threads app has almost 100 million users, says Mark Zuckerberg","alternativeHeadline":"Watch out, Elon: ‘I’ve thought for a long time there should be a billion-person public conversations app that is a bit more positive,’ says Meta’s CEO.","datePublished":"2023-10-25T21:47:07.964Z","dateModified":"2023-10-25T21:47:07.964Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/25/23932473/mark-zuckerberg-threads-100-million-monthly-users-earnings","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jay Peters","url":"https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters"}],"articleBody":"The rumors of Threads’ early demise have been exaggerated.\n\nMeta’s competitor to Elon Musk’s X has hit “just under” 100 million monthly users since it was released in early July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Wednesday during his company’s quarterly earnings call. \n\n“We’re three months in now, and I’m very happy with the trajectory,” he said, echoing the bullish comments he made about how Threads is doing during a recent interview with The Verge. “We’re now getting to the point where we’re going to be focusing on growing the community further. From what we can tell, people love it so far.”\n\nAs the head of Instagram explained at the launch of Threads, Meta sees an opening to seriously compete with the platform formerly known as Twitter now that Musk has blown it up to create his X super app vision. \n\n\"“I’ve thought for a long time there should be a billion-person public conversations app that is a bit more positive”\"\n\n“I’ve thought for a long time there should be a billion-person public conversations app that is a bit more positive,” Zuckerberg said on Wednesday’s call. “I think that if we keep at this for a few more years, then I think we have a good chance of achieving our vision there.”\n\nMeta CFO Susan Li shared some optimism, too. “Threads also remains a compelling long-term opportunity, and we’re excited to build on the strong product momentum we have going into next year,” she said during the call.\n\nMeta launched Threads in July. While it was fairly barebones to start, the company has swiftly added a lot of welcome features, including a web app, the ability to search for posts, and an edit feature that you don’t have to pay for. The app remains unavailable in Europe due to Meta’s uncertainty about its ability to comply with new regulation there. \n\nIn a Threads post on Wednesday, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri said that “I’m hoping we can land support for Europe, early Fediverse progress, better Instagram integrations, and trends in the next few months.”\n\nIf you’re curious to hear Zuckerberg talk more about Threads, including his history of competing with Twitter and Meta’s plan to decentralize it, check out his recent interview on Decoder.\n\n[Media: https://youtu.be/9aCg7jH4S1w?si=Ovpm_OH6YFTn0_SW]\n\nAs part of its third-quarter earnings report, Meta said that it earned $34 billion in revenue, up 23 percent from the same quarter last year. However, it’s still burning cash with its Reality Labs division; the company expects its operating losses there to increase “meaningfully” year-over-year.\n\nUpdate October 25th, 7:32PM ET: Added post from Adam Mosseri.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"If you don’t like seeing Threads posts on Instagram and Facebook, Meta says it’s “listening to feedback.”","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-10-23T23:23:49.732Z","dateModified":"2023-10-23T23:23:49.732Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23929601/if-you-dont-like-seeing-threads-posts-on-instagram-and-facebook-meta-says-its-listening-to-feedback","author":[],"articleBody":"That said, Meta has eyes on making Threads a billion-user social network, so I think we might just have to get used to seeing Threads posts in other Meta apps.\n\n[Attachment: https://www.threads.net/@threads/post/CyvzNdhuD39]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"More good new Threads features.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-10-17T20:53:33.963Z","dateModified":"2023-10-17T20:53:33.963Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921527/another-good-new-threads-feature","author":[],"articleBody":"If you tap and hold on a post with a bunch of tagged people on the Threads mobile app, you’ll see a menu where you can follow everyone that’s mentioned, as shared by Instagram head Adam Mosseri.

When drafting a new post on the iOS app, I tapped a new microphone button to access the recording interface, and then I could press a red record button to record my voice.

The data, which was first reported on by CNBC, suggests that Threads will have far fewer monthly active users than Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok by the end of this year, but it may still have a chance to close the gap with X.\n\nInsider Intelligence indicates that Threads will have 23.7 million active monthly users in the US by the end of 2023. That’s far fewer than what’s expected for Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, which Insider Intelligence says could have 177.9 million, 135.2 million, and 102.3 million respective US active monthly users by the end of 2023. \n\nSurprisingly, Elon Musk’s X is forecast to have 56.1 million active monthly users in the US by the end of 2023, but Insider Intelligence warns that this number won’t stay high for long. The agency predicts that X’s monthly active users will have dropped to 47 million by 2025 if users continue to defect from the platform. Conversely, Insider Intelligence predicts Threads could have 30 million users in 2025.\n\n“Threads received an initial boost from Twitter’s missteps, but it can’t rely on X defectors to continue to grow,” Jasmine Enberg, Insider Intelligence’s principal analyst, says in a statement. Enberg adds that if Musk goes through with his plan to charge everyone to access X, it could further alienate its user base.\n\nThreads quickly surpassed 100 million signups after its launch. However, the number of daily active users on the platform rapidly declined in the following weeks, with Sensor Tower and Similarweb reporting significant drop-offs. Since its launch, Meta has rolled out a Threads web app, along with several highly-requested features including a search feature, a following feed, and a way to share posts through Instagram DMs. Although Threads is meant to be a direct replacement for X, it may need to add more than just core features in order for it to gain and keep new users.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Threads might be getting an edit button soon","alternativeHeadline":"Threads’ in-the-works edit button might be available for five minutes after you make a post.","datePublished":"2023-09-21T20:15:35.409Z","dateModified":"2023-09-21T20:15:35.409Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884466/threads-edit-button-development-instagram-meta","author":[],"articleBody":"Meta’s in-development edit button for Threads might let you edit posts within five minutes of publishing them, as reported by developer Alessandro Paluzzi on X (formerly Twitter).

You’ll be able to post, interact with other posts, and look at your feed, spokesperson Christine Pai tells The Verge. As of Thursday, the web version is live for everyone, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in a post.\n\nAt first, Threads on the web was essentially a glorified way to look at somebody’s profile — you couldn’t even like or reshare a post even though the web app included the buttons to do so. (If you clicked them, Threads would show you a QR code to download the mobile app.) The new desktop web interface looks a lot like the one in the mobile app, though with some small differences; the navigation icons are on the top of the page, and to switch between the For You and Following feeds, you’ll click a button in the bottom-left corner.  \n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1zbGUPOhryHLfZ3QA9emYYWRbEk=/0x0:1223x790/1223x790/filters:focal(612x395:613x396)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24864945/desktop_loggedin_activity__1_.png]\n\nHowever, the web experience doesn’t let you do everything that you can in the mobile app. According to Pai, that means you can’t do things like edit your profile or send a post to Instagram DMs from the web. After using the web version for a couple days, I don’t like that there’s no notification dot on the heart icon and that you can’t quote post (aka quote tweet).\n\nThe Threads team is promising that things will get better. “This is an early v1,” Tom Bender, a PM on the Threads team, said in a post. “We’re painfully aware of the feature gaps and it’s going to improve quickly.”\n\nAnd even though there’s missing features, I’m thrilled that there’s even a bare-bones level of functionality available. I much prefer using social media apps on the web on my computer, especially since I spend the vast majority of my workday in a desktop web browser. Jumping over to my phone just to post something on Threads was starting to get annoying, so I bet I’ll be using this new web version of Threads quite a bit.\n\n[Media: https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/CwP2yyiL15R]\n\nThreads had a splashy launch at the beginning of July to take advantage of the unhappiness toward Elon Musk’s Twitter. The app hit 100 million users in a matter of days, easily eclipsing ChatGPT’s huge release last year, even though the app still isn’t available in the European Union.\n\nDespite the big launch, some analytics firms have reported that Threads usage has plummeted; perhaps the improved web app and forthcoming better search will convince some lapsed users to return.\n\nUpdate August 24th, 1:45AM ET: Added posts from people working on Threads.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Meta may launch a Threads web version early this week","alternativeHeadline":"A new report says Threads is getting one of users’ most requested features early this week.","datePublished":"2023-08-21T01:10:31.107Z","dateModified":"2023-08-21T01:10:31.107Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/20/23839495/meta-threads-web-version-coming-this-week","author":[],"articleBody":"Meta will launch the web version of Threads, its competitor to X (formerly known as Twitter) early this week, reports The Wall Street Journal.

To be clear, this isn’t a free way to get a blue checkmark next to your Threads name; you’ll probably need to pay Meta to get one of those. Instead, this new feature helps you prove on other platforms that a Threads profile that you link to is one that you own. But it also represents something bigger: an actual Threads feature from Meta that connects with decentralized social media.\n\nI got this to work in just a few minutes on my Mastodon profile, meaning that a URL to my Threads account now has a green checkmark. I’ll explain how I got this set up a bit later in this story, but for now, here’s a screenshot of what it looks like:\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dGjIo93ZnlRPiOupRezgYIye8tQ=/0x0:565x519/565x519/filters:focal(283x260:284x261)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24840571/Screenshot_2023_08_09_at_12.15.51_PM.png]\n\nMosseri announced the update as part of a thread about some other new features announced on Wednesday. “We’ve also rolled out Threads support for rel=me links to help you verify your identity on platforms like Mastodon,” Mosseri said. “You can now add your Threads profile link on supported platforms to verify your identity.”\n\nA post from Threads engineer Jesse Chen, known on the site as 0xjessel, explains that “for folks outside of the Fediverse this might not mean much, but my hope is that folks take this as a sign that we’re embracing open standards seriously.”\n\n[Media: https://www.threads.net/@0xjessel/post/Cvu7-A4viZu/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==]\n\nI’ll admit that I didn’t know what rel=me links were when I read Mosseri’s post (I only saw Chen’s post later), so I found a Mastodon support page that explained how they work. “If you put an HTTPS link in your profile metadata, Mastodon checks if that link resolves to a web page that links back to your Mastodon profile with a special rel=me attribute,” according to the document. “If so, you get a verification checkmark next to that link, since you are confirmed as the owner.”\n\nIf your eyes are glazing over reading all that, never fear: I found it was ultimately pretty straightforward to make my Mastodon account show a verified checkmark for my Threads profile. Here’s how I did it:\n\n1. On my Threads profile, I changed my featured link to be my Mastodon profile URL.\n2. Then, on my Mastodon profile, I changed one of the featured links to be my Threads profile URL.\n3. After I saved that change, my Mastodon profile showed a green verification checkmark next to my Threads profile URL. Success!\n\nMosseri has said that Meta plans to eventually integrate Threads with the decentralized ActivityPub protocol, and I’ve been skeptical about Meta following through. But now that the company rolled out this verification feature that works on non-Threads platforms, I’m starting to believe that we’ll actually see ActivityPub support in Threads proper someday.\n\nUpdate August 10th, 2023, 11:15AM ET: This article has been updated to add 0xjessel’s comment.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Threads is getting some useful new features","alternativeHeadline":"Including the ability to add custom alt text to photos and videos.","datePublished":"2023-08-09T16:06:10.390Z","dateModified":"2023-08-09T16:06:10.390Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23825931/meta-threads-custom-alt-text-photos-videos-instagram-dm-mentions","author":[],"articleBody":"Threads, Meta’s Twitter competitor, is getting some new features “this week,” according to a post from CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

To add alt text, start a post, attach photos or videos using the paperclip icon, and then tap the “Alt” button that appears on the image. I don’t appear to have the mention button — maybe I’m missing it! — but you can mention another user while drafting a post by entering the @ symbol and then typing somebody’s username or picking from one of the suggested options.

Its engagement is also estimated to have slowed significantly since that initial rush of signups, though Zuckerberg said last week that “tens of millions” of people were still using the app daily.\n\nAccording to Zuckerberg, the main focus for Threads, beyond adding key missing features, is improving the app’s retention with current users. “I’m highly confident we’re going to be able to pour enough gasoline on this to help it grow” after that work is done, he said.

(Elon Musk has told his employees that he wants his X super-app idea to eventually hit 1 billion users, too, though he has very different ideas for getting there.)\n\n“We’ve tried a bunch of standalone experiences over time, and in general, we haven’t had a lot of success with standalone apps,” Zuckerberg told investors. “Part of me wonders if this is just a classic venture capital portfolio question, where you try a bunch of things and a bunch of them don’t work, and once in a while, one hits... it could be that this is such an idiocratic case because of all the factors happening around Twitter, or X as it’s called now.”\n\nMeta’s business has rebounded significantly this year, and for the second quarter, it reported better-than-expected earnings that sent its stock price higher. The company’s total revenue was $32 billion, with a net income of $7.78 billion. Its Reality Labs division, meanwhile, reported a net loss of $3.7 billion. Management warned investors to expect those losses to “meaningfully” increase due to “ongoing product development efforts” in augmented and virtual reality, like the release of the Quest 3 headset later this year.\n\n\"“I think we’re really just focused on taking this opportunity, which is an awesome one that we didn’t expect at this scale”\"\n\nEven with those staggering losses at Reality Labs, Meta doesn’t feel pressure to monetize Threads in the near term. Its established social networks — Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp — have never been bigger. Even Facebook has surpassed 3 billion monthly users and is growing again in the US and Canada, the company announced on Wednesday. \n\nWhile Twitter is scrambling to recover the ad revenue it has lost since Musk took over, Zuckerberg said on the earnings call that Threads wouldn’t introduce ads until it reaches “hundreds of millions” of users. “I think we’re really just focused on taking this opportunity, which is an awesome one that we didn’t expect at this scale,” he said. “It’s going to be a long road ahead.”\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Yes, the Threads desktop web site is coming.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-07-25T20:51:18.442Z","dateModified":"2023-07-25T20:51:18.442Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/25/23807614/yes-the-threads-desktop-web-site-is-coming","author":[],"articleBody":"No surprise, but Adam Mosseri tells Casey Newton web Threads is indeed en route.\n\n[Attachment: https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/CvIlttpNHLg/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==]\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Threads is rolling out its Following feed","alternativeHeadline":"One of the most requested features is finally rolling out after this week’s update.","datePublished":"2023-07-25T15:19:55.302Z","dateModified":"2023-07-25T15:19:55.302Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/25/23806982/threads-instagram-following-feed-launch","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jay Peters","url":"https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters"}],"articleBody":"One of Instagram Threads’ most requested features is finally here: the Following tab that lets you see only the people you, er, follow. “Ask and you shall receive,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on Threads quoting a user asking for the feature.\n\nFor those of us who have the Following feed, we can make it appear and disappear by tapping the home icon or the Threads logo at the top of the page.

Its arrival came after months of anticipation, but ultimately a bit earlier than Meta had planned. Elon Musk’s characteristically self-defeating move to limit free users to viewing a small number of tweets each day had given Meta an unusually opportune moment to strike, and it seized the moment.\n\nThe outsized success that followed — Threads was the fastest app to hit 100 million downloads, and later blew past 150 million — came as a surprise to almost everyone involved. That includes the app’s makers at Meta, who hadn’t built a homegrown hit this big since Facebook itself.\n\nIt was not for lack of trying. The company has released well over a dozen social apps over the past decade, many of them springing from a standalone division of the company devoted to that purpose. But few of them, if any, acquired millions of downloads. Even when it was attempting to copy the success of others, as it did with now-forgotten Snapchat clones like Poke and Slingshot, Meta mostly couldn’t get them off the ground.\n\n\"This week, the response has been notably more muted\"\n\nI mention all this context because, as the early enthusiasm for Threads begins to fade, Meta is facing more questions about whether the app is here to stay. The analytics firm SimilarWeb estimated that Threads users had fallen from 49 million people 10 days ago to 23.6 million today, with time spent in the app declining from an average of 21 minutes per day to 6 minutes during the same period.\n\nWhile third-party estimates are never totally reliable, these figures seem consistent with my own Threads experience. In those first few days, nearly everything I posted generated hundreds of likes and new followers; my phone vibrated so much that I could watch its battery drain in real time. This week, though, the response has been notably more muted.\n\nSo what’s going on?\n\nIn the New York Times, Mike Isaac noted that the notorious flop Google+ once claimed 90 million users, only to fall apart shortly after reaching those heights. I thought the comparison was worth raising: every social network struggles to retain users over time, and the bare-bones, 1.0 version of Threads displays little on the surface to suggest how it could overtake a much more established rival like Twitter.\n\nIt’s always a fool’s errand to judge the prospects of a new social network a couple weeks into its history. At the same time, if Threads does live up to its creators’ hopes, bringing decentralized apps into the mainstream, it could reshape the consumer internet in profound ways.\n\nFor that reason, I feel compelled to offer some early thoughts on why I believe Threads is on its way to fully supplanting Twitter in the role that company once played in shaping public conversation.\n\nII.\n\nOne, Threads proved decisively the demand for a new text-based conversation app. Until this month, it was unclear that tens of millions of people even wanted something Twitter-like in their lives. Twitter itself has been in a period of steep decline, and the various clones that have sprung up in its wake have stalled out in the low millions of users. That Threads attracted so many downloads in so short a period offers compelling evidence that lots of people have been waiting for a company to do public conversations the right way.\n\nTwo, Threads immediately attracted the sort of high-profile user base that made Twitter so addictive for so long. Within days, my feed was populated with posts from athletes like Shaquille O’Neal, journalists like Katie Couric and Ezra Klein, and comedians like Kathy Griffin. They brought an instant legitimacy to Threads that rivals like Mastodon never quite cracked. Other Twitter clones, particularly the decentralized ones, have struggled to persuade people that they aren’t just for nerds. Threads never had that problem.\n\n\"What happens once public figures on Facebook can add their most recent Threads posts?\"\n\nThree, Instagram can serve as a long-term growth driver for Threads. One of the most impressive things about the Threads launch was how it connects to Instagram. A badge on your Instagram profile lets everyone know how early you joined Threads, spurring others to race to create accounts of their own. And from the start, Threads could be shared to Instagram stories with a couple of taps, bridging the two apps together in a smart and useful way. As both apps evolve, I expect we’ll see many more touches like this, with each leveraging its own strengths to promote the other.\n\nFour, Meta still has many other growth levers it can pull — many of which simply involve building basic features the user base has already requested. It will soon let users post and browse from the desktop, for example. It will let users browse a feed of posts created only by users they follow — a must for news junkies. Once it works through various data privacy issues, Threads will come to the European Union, with its hundreds of millions of potential users. (It’s a good sign for Meta that EU citizens are so intent on using it the company has had to block them at the VPN level.)\n\nMeta will also be able to promote Threads across its family of apps, in ways both expected and not. What happens once public figures on Facebook can add their most recent Threads posts to their pages? I bet we’ll find out.\n\nFive, Twitter’s deterioration continues to accelerate. Ad revenue is down by 50 percent, according to Musk, and — despite the company choosing not to pay many of its bills — the company is losing money. Rate limits continue to make the site unusable to many free users and even some paid ones. Spam is overwhelming users’ direct messages so much that the company disabled open DMs to free users. The company has lately been reduced to issuing bribe-like payouts to a handful of hand-picked creators, many of whom are aligned with right-wing politics.\n\nIf that’s not a death spiral, what is? In Puck, William Cohan has written persuasively that Twitter could soon be subject to involuntary bankruptcy. And while that could be in Musk’s financial interests — making billions of dollars in debt disappear — the resulting chaos seems unlikely to restore the site to its former usability.\n\nIII.\n\nSo that’s the case for Threads working out in the end. The demand is there, the product is good, and its chief rival is circling the drain. (Other rivals don’t seem to be faring much better; Bluesky, which had been my favorite Twitter alternative in recent weeks, has been mired in internecine conflict over the past week related to the use of racial slurs in user names. Even worse, from a growth standpoint, is that the app remains invite-only.)\n\nOf course, lots could still go wrong for Meta. I’m particularly focused on what kind of posts are ultimately favored by Threads’ ranking algorithms.\n\n\"The best version of Threads is an app where people learn and discuss what’s happening in the moment\"\n\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri drew headlines for saying the company is “not going to do anything to encourage” posting about politics or “hard news.” To me, this sounded mostly like marketing — “come use our app where everyone is arguing about politics” likely would not have drawn 100 million people to download the app in a week. I suspect Threads will ultimately lean into whatever its users are doing, even if it means hosting lots of fractious debates about democracy and fascism.\n\nBut if Threads winds up writing Mosseri’s viewpoint here into the code, the app could be sapped of its lifeblood. Threads doesn’t only have to be about news, just as Twitter wasn’t. But the best version of Threads is an app where people go to learn about and discuss what’s happening in the moment, news included, and absent that the feed is going to feel like one more overstuffed shopping mall for a company that already has plenty of those. (The earliest days of Threads, when the timeline was dominated by brands posting cringey engagement-bait, offer a good roadmap for what the company should avoid.)\n\nUltimately, despite encroaching doubts among critics, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems unfazed.\n\n“I’m very optimistic about how the Threads community is coming together,” he wrote in a Threads post today. “Early growth was off the charts, but more importantly 10s of millions of people now come back daily. That’s way ahead of what we expected.”\n\nIndeed, it’s a rare thing for any social network to claim tens of millions of daily active users, much less one that is barely more than a minimum viable product. BeReal, one of the more prominent upstarts of the past couple years, announced it had 20 million daily users in April — and I imagine that number is smaller now.\n\nTo Zuckerberg, the concept has been proved out. The rest is simply an execution problem.\n\n“The focus for the rest of the year is improving the basics and retention,” he wrote. “It’ll take time to stabilize, but once we nail that then we’ll focus on growing the community. We’ve run this playbook many times (FB, IG, Stories, Reels, etc) and I’m confident Threads is on a good path too.”\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Mark Zuckerberg says that tens of millions of people are returning to Threads every day.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-07-17T22:55:48.125Z","dateModified":"2023-07-17T22:55:48.125Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23798294/mark-zuckerberg-says-that-tens-of-millions-of-people-are-returning-to-threads-every-day","author":[],"articleBody":"That’s “way ahead” of what the company expected, he said on Threads.

It was a deserved victory lap for a company that hasn’t launched a successful standalone app from scratch since… forever.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of the Threads launch, as Instagram chief Adam Mosseri later explained in the meeting, was how it was built. A team of just three product managers, three designers, and “50ish” engineers created and launched it within five months. For Meta and its Big Tech peers, such constraints for a big, splashy bet are unheard of.\n\nMany commentators have been quick to point out that sign-ups alone aren’t a signal of success, and Meta knows this. “We are very excited and thrilled at how many people have signed up,” Mosseri told employees yesterday. “We’re also trying to keep perspective and remember that it’s easier to get people to sign up than it is to build something that people want to use in a month or a year from now. So we’re very, very focused on retention.”\n\nFacebook defined the gold standard for social media retention many years ago, and it remains an incredibly sticky product to this day (more on that later). It’s obviously too early to know if Threads will be as sticky, though there are signs it could be. \n\nI’ve obtained some eye-popping, early usage stats: There have been over 70 billion impressions, 450 million posts (excluding reposts), and over 4.5 billion likes on Threads to date. That’s real engagement. Mosseri said in yesterday’s meeting that the company is working to thwart fake activity and that, at least for now, bot prevalence is “roughly the same level as Instagram.”\n\nThere are already some key usage differences between Threads and Twitter. The goal is to be a place that is “less angry or more friendly, depending on how you want to frame it,” according to Mosseri. He has already drawn headlines for telling me that Threads won’t prioritize news, which is to be expected given Meta’s many bruises from trying that in the past. \n\n\"The goal is to be a place that is ‘less angry or more friendly, depending on how you want to frame it’\"\n\nCompany leadership is fully aware that publishers and journalists like myself are already embracing the platform, however. I haven’t heard anything about news being intentionally suppressed in Threads, though Mosseri did hint on yesterday’s call that the company is “ranking things a little bit more thoughtfully.”\n\nBased on internal Meta data I’ve seen, the biggest region for Threads usage (by a wide margin) is the US, followed by Brazil, while Twitter’s biggest market after the US has historically been Japan. And while Twitter has leaned heavily into video under Musk, Mosseri was clear during yesterday’s meeting that text will remain the primary media type on Threads. \n\nAds will come to Threads “over the long run,” but he reiterated that monetization isn’t a priority right now. I have a feeling that Twitter’s introduction of creator payouts this week could speed up Meta’s work to give creators ways to make money on Threads, though I’m not sure Mosseri’s team feels the heat to do so quite yet.\n\nA question that likely wasn’t contemplated inside Meta before the launch of Threads was raised during yesterday’s Q\u0026A: Do we see Instagram traffic declining due to the introduction of Threads? (Translation: Could this thing be so successful that it actually makes us lose money in the short term?)\n\nMosseri said Instagram’s usage wasn’t hurting so far but that it was “something that we’re going to keep a close eye on… If the pie grows [overall], I think that’s a good thing. But we definitely want to understand if we’re mix-shifting attention between the apps in the family.”\n\nHe was quick to acknowledge “tons of things that are missing” in the app, including better accessibility support, the ability to search for posts, an edit button, and a following feed. Meta wants Threads to be officially available in the European Union, though the looming Digital Markets Act regulation makes that timing uncertain. And the promised integration with ActivityPub, the decentralized social media protocol that also powers Mastodon, is a “long while” out but still a priority, too, per Mosseri. “We’re just working through the list and burning it down.”\n\n---\n\n[Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SDlyuuAG2wORl-aHJWapoNuk6Y0=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24788800/Tom_Alison.png]\n\nFacebook’s big milestone\n\nIt wasn’t just Threads hitting big milestones for Meta this week. Facebook reached 3 billion monthly active users. The head of the app, Tom Alison, announced the stat in an internal post earlier this week and joined Mosseri on Thursday’s Q\u0026A call to talk about the high-level strategy for the blue app.\n\nThe overall sentiment of Alison’s remarks, if I could sum them up, was we’re still here. Facebook still makes Meta a ton of money and, despite what headlines would suggest, has picked up its pace of growth recently. Alison said that the company had also reversed the worrisome trend of declining usage from people aged 18-29. “Facebook’s in it for years to come, and we’re going to be alive and well,” he said during yesterday’s meeting.\n\nGiven how Facebook is now a hodgepodge of different experiences, from the main feed to Groups to its Craigslist competitor, Marketplace, it’s fair to wonder what the app’s main purpose is anymore. “We’re really all about people who are curious,” according to Alison, “who want to explore the world through others, through real people, real connection, through community, through creators, [and] through their friends.” It’s interesting that friends, the original core value proposition of Facebook, now comes last in that sentence.\n\nA big push now is making Facebook more of a place for creators to build followings, said Alison. There are now 60 million “pro” accounts on Facebook, which give people extra features and the ability to earn engagement-based payouts for their content. That’s up from 30 million at the beginning of this year. “We’re making a lot of progress with creators and public figures now,” he said. “I think we were a little bit late to figure this out, but I feel like we’re on a good track right now. And, I think, over time, you’re going to hear Facebook more in the public conversation.”\n\n---\n\n[Image: ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1m-4ms1nYFnKXKQDQwvP7tdZl78=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24788801/Zhang_Yiming.png]\n\nByteDance lets US employees cash out\n\nIf you want a sign that ByteDance isn’t going to spin off TikTok, look no further than this week’s news that US-based employees will be able to, for the first time, participate in the company’s share buyback program. \n\nAs first reported by Reuters, ByteDance has changed the vesting requirements for the stock it issues US employees so that they can sell their shares without the company going public or having another liquidity event (like a spinoff), giving them the ability to participate in the next buyback later this year. It wouldn’t make sense to go through the trouble of changing this policy if a spinoff was on the near horizon.\n\nAfter talking to current and former employees, the reaction to the news seems to be mostly excitement. Many are also wondering why this didn’t happen sooner, given that ByteDance has already done several rounds of buybacks with employees outside of the US. There also seems to be some confusion about the tax burden facing employees who are vested or vesting soon and what price the shares will be sold at later this year. Documents shared with employees that I’ve seen say the company will share more on all that soon.\n\nThere’s something else that TikTok employees would like to hear more about: the fate of the app in the US since the threat of a ban still looms. Nothing has been shared internally on that front recently, I’m told.\n\n---\n\n[Image: Ex IRL CEO Abraham Shafi. https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ivfwEBIj7WcTQRgOozeXV-yiWgc=/0x0:1000x1000/1000x1000/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24788807/Abraham_Shafi.jpg]\n\nAn IRL update\n\nThanks to all of the former IRL employees who have responded since I wrote about the social media startup, which raised $200 million, dissolving due to alleged fraud. \n\nIt’s clear that a contingent is still in disbelief about the board’s claim that 95 percent of the users were bots, though I found ousted CEO Abraham Shafi’s rebuttal to be lacking in substance. There’s something fishy going on here for sure.\n\nI don’t want to overplay my hand too early, so for now, all I’ll say is that I’d love to keep chatting with former employees and investors.

One senior executive at a Big Tech company jokingly mused to me recently that to be sued by Khan these days must be an indication that you’re doing something right. Her agency’s ire has become a weird, cynical badge of honor, creating an “enemy of my enemy” kinsmanship among leaders at tech firms that normally wouldn’t be friendly with each other.  \n\nAfter losing her case to block Microsoft from buying Activision, it’s clear that Khan’s playbook for fighting tech M\u0026A isn’t working.

That’s despite Twitter currently being filled with links to Threads content, which you’d expect to be able to find via search. We spotted the behavior via a Threads post from Andy Baio, but the behavior is also being widely reported by Twitter users.\n\nThe issue was first noticed when using the “url:” search operator, which is normally used to search for links to a specific URL. For example, searching “url:theverge.com” on Twitter brings up every single tweet that links to any page on The Verge, regardless of whether the URL has been shortened. But searching for “url:threads.net” returns zero results, despite there being plenty of tweets that link to the domain. \n\n[Media: https://www.threads.net/t/CuiTZi9PFqU]\n\nLikewise, searching for “threads.net” without the “url:” operator turns up dozens of irrelevant results from users with their Threads account in their display name, or who are talking about the service without linking to it — it doesn’t surface any linked Threads posts.\n\nIt’s still possible to find links to Threads posts on Twitter, but you’ll have to get creative. Searching for “url:“threads net”” with a space between “threads” and “net” is the best workaround we’ve seen, and you can also still search for specific Thread post URLs (like this). But the apparent restriction adds friction to the process, making it harder to easily find a broad array of Threads links on Twitter.\n\nIt’s unclear how intentional this behavior is, and an enquiry sent to Twitter’s press line returned the customary poop emoji auto-reply. But Twitter owner Elon Musk has been intensely critical of Threads and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “Competition is fine, cheating is not,” Musk tweeted on July 6th. “Zuck is a cuck,” was his less measured response three days later. Twitter has also threatened to sue Meta over Threads, claiming Meta has engaged in “systematic, willful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter’s trade secrets and other intellectual property.”\n\nIf it is intentional, however, it wouldn’t be the first time Twitter has limited the visibility of other services on its platform. In early April Twitter limited how users could engage with posts containing links to Substack on the eve of the newsletter service’s launch of its Notes microblogging service. Users were unable to like, reply to, or retweet tweets containing Substack URLs, and Twitter then started marking Substack links as unsafe. Twitter also redirected searches for “Substack” to the much more general “newsletter.” \n\nElon Musk attempted to justify the limitations placed on Substack links by saying the service “was trying to download a massive portion of the Twitter database to bootstrap their Twitter clone.” But his concerns appeared to be short-lived: a day later Substack said “the suppression of Substack publications on Twitter” appeared to be over. \n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Here’s how your Threads feed works right now.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-07-10T21:20:24.645Z","dateModified":"2023-07-10T21:20:24.645Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23790415/heres-how-your-threads-feed-works-right-now","author":[],"articleBody":"According to the @threadsapp account, you’ll see both people you follow and accounts the platform recommends to you.

The app gained over 100 million users in less than a week after launching in more than 100 countries, including the US and UK — but you won’t be able to download it in the European Union anytime soon. The app has been held up by what Meta spokesperson Christine Pai described to The Verge as “upcoming regulatory uncertainty,” widely assumed to refer to the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\nTech companies and regulatory skeptics have long claimed that laws like the DMA hold back innovation by requiring onerous user protections, but the looming competition law doesn’t stop Meta from introducing new products — and Meta hasn’t indicated it will forgo a European launch. If anything, the DMA adds friction to slow down a product’s launch and force the company to evaluate how it protects users before letting it out in the wild — even if it diminishes Threads’ popularity out of the gate. But there’s still plenty of uncertainty as companies wait for more guidance later this fall as well as an open question: will complying with Europe’s rules undercut the design that’s let Threads grow so quickly?\n\n\"The DMA adds friction to slow down a product’s launch and force the company to evaluate how it protects users before letting it out in the wild\"\n\nPai and other Meta reps have declined to blame any one of Europe’s many tech regulations for the Threads delay. But interviews with Instagram head Adam Mosseri suggest the EU’s Digital Markets Act is at fault. The regulation, passed last year, includes a host of new rules that intend to rein in companies it’s defined as “gatekeepers” — which hit a certain user base and market cap threshold — from abusing their market power. Meta and other Big Tech companies like Google and TikTok, were formally designated as gatekeepers earlier this month, providing them with six months to prepare before any enforcement actions could take place. \n\nMosseri attributed the postponement to a variety of issues. But he specifically noted rules preventing Meta from mixing the data it collects from users across products like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\n“It’s not just disclosures and consent. It’s also verifying that there’s no data leakage,” Mosseri told The New York Times’ Hard Fork podcast on Thursday. “You have to put in place processes and technology that all but guarantee that anything you say, you can verify; and usually multiple ways.”\n\nThe DMA prevents companies as big as Meta from reusing a user’s personal data — including their name and location — across its products for targeted advertising without user consent. Meta’s own privacy policy discloses that it collects and uses information across its products to serve users ads. Information from Apple’s App Store suggests that Threads could collect a wide array of sensitive data, including health and location data as well as a user’s contacts and search history.\n\nIt doesn’t look like Threads collects vast amounts more data than Meta’s other services, and the mere collection wouldn’t get it into trouble. It’s the DMA’s rules around data mixing, or combining all of the data it collects on users to build advertising profiles, that could break the rules. German regulators already ordered the company to stop combining WhatsApp and Instagram data without user consent back in 2019. The DMA would apply similar rules all across Europe, forcing the company to require European users to opt in before their personal information could be combined across platforms.\n\nTargeted advertising is an issue for most Meta services, but it might not be the biggest problem Threads faces. Much of the app’s immediate success can be attributed to its connection with Instagram. In order to make an account on Threads, users must connect their Instagram accounts and use the same account names. Then, they can use Instagram to automatically follow the accounts they were already following on that platform on Threads. \n\nThe problem is, the DMA bans gatekeepers from providing more favorable treatment to their own products on its platforms over that of its competitors, otherwise called “self-preferencing.” Self-preferencing has been used to describe how companies like Amazon and Google push their own products, like Amazon Basics and Google’s reviews, to the top of a user’s search results, putting their competitors at a disadvantage.\n\nGeorgios Petropoulos, Stanford Digital Economy Lab digital fellow, told The Verge in an interview on Thursday that Threads wasn’t an unambiguous self-preferencing case — but that it did raise concerns. “If it uses the existing popular products it has like Instagram, like Facebook, to promote this new platform, that could also be viewed as something,” said Petropoulos. “It’s not a clear violation of the self-preferencing obligation, but it could be considered this way.” The EU is expected to provide more guidance to companies this fall, potentially clearing up the confusion.\n\n\"“It’s not a clear violation of the self-preferencing obligation, but it could be considered this way.” \"\n\nMeta has already been forced to unwind some of its products due to EU intervention in the past. In 2020, Germany’s competition watchdog began investigating Meta for requiring Oculus (now Quest) virtual reality headset users to sign in to their accounts with a Facebook login. Last year, Meta ultimately caved and untied the headsets from the social accounts. Threads’ Instagram login requirement could cause similar problems for Meta but with costlier consequences. The DMA allows for fines of up to 10 percent of a company’s annual revenue for violations and even up to 20 percent for repeated infringements as well as additional nonfinancial remedies. \n\nMany of the problems raised by the DMA could be solved by allowing users to create Threads accounts with just their emails, not Instagram accounts. Meta could decide to do this in the future. The question is whether that additional friction will slow the app’s tremendous growth — particularly because Meta took extra steps to make the app “sticky” thanks to Instagram, like only letting people delete their account if they sacrifice their Instagram account, too.\n\nOn Monday, Rob Sherman, Meta’s chief privacy officer for police, wrote on Threads that the app currently meets the EU’s GDPR privacy requirements, “but building this offering against the backdrop of other regulatory requirements that have not yet been clarified would potentially take a lot longer, and in the face of this uncertainty, we prioritized offering this new product to as many people as possible.”\n\nIn his Hard Fork interview, Mosseri suggested that Meta would need to create new systems to prove that Threads was following all of the EU’s rules.\n\nMosseri referred to the Threads launch as “a lot more of a yolo launch than anything we’ve done in awhile.” That breakneck launch speed may fly in the US, but some lawmakers in the EU seem fine with waiting for it to be available later. With Threads’ sudden success, it’s unlikely that Meta would refuse to launch the app in Europe forever — and since the app launched with bare-bones features and an awkward algorithmic feed, they might get a more fully baked platform as well as one with more privacy protections. \n\n“The fact that Threads is still not available for EU citizens shows that EU regulation works,” said Christel Schaldemose, a Danish lawmaker, according to Politico last week. “I hope Meta will make sure all rules are covered and complied with before opening up for EU citizens.”\n\nUpdate July 10th, 5:33PM ET: Included statements from Rob Sherman, Meta’s chief privacy officer for policy.\n\nCorrection July 10th, 8:11PM ET: Threads launched in more than 100 countries, not hundreds of countries as we originally reported.

OpenAI’s chatbot passed the mark after two months, but Threads, which only launched on Wednesday, got there in a matter of days. The number of users can be found in the Instagram app, which tracks the size of the Threads userbase.\n\nThreads proved to be an early hit almost immediately. In the first two hours, it hit 2 million users and steadily climbed from there to 5 million, 10 million, 30 million, and then 70 million. The launch has been “way beyond our expectations,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Friday. \n\nOn Monday, Zuckerberg said in a Threads post confirming the milestone that the growth was “mostly organic:”\n\n[Media: https://www.threads.net/t/CuhOXGmr74R/]\n\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri also posted about it, likewise noting that it took just five days to get there:\n\n[Media: https://www.threads.net/t/CuhPRxzgzBT/]\n\nUsers aren’t just signing up: they’re posting, too. As of Thursday, my colleague Alex Heath reported that there have already been more than 95 million posts and 190 million likes shared on the app. \n\nThat said, Threads is still in its infancy, and we’ll have to wait and see if it captures the same cultural cachet that Twitter once did. Meta isn’t specifically targeting trying to replace Twitter, according to Instagram head Adam Mosseri, and the company isn’t going to actively encourage politics and hard news on the platform, but it could end up being the place people go for a conversation-based social media platform. And while Meta “couldn’t be more psyched” about how the launch week has gone, “we don’t even know if this thing is retentive yet,” Mosseri said.\n\nAlthough the numbers aren’t directly comparable, as of last November Twitter had around 260 million monetizable daily active users, per a tweet from owner Elon Musk at the time.

As of Monday, July 10th, the Threads account currently has 80,000 followers.\n\nSweeney addressed his second posting on the @elonmusksjet Threads account directly to Mark Zuckerberg, asking the Meta founder if he can remain on the platform. Sweeney includes a shoutout in the Threads bio of @elonmusksjet to the @zuckerbergjet account dedicated to tracking the location of Zuckerberg’s private jet. That account hasn’t posted any live information yet, but Sweeney has been actively tracking the movements of Zuckerberg’s jet across Meta’s Facebook and Instagram services for some time. \n\n[Media: https://www.threads.net/t/CuVa0zOvXMP]\n\nThe account tracking Musk’s jet already appears to have been suspended and subsequently restored on both Threads and Instagram (where it’s been active for months) in the last few days.\n\nElon Musk suspended the @ElonJet Twitter account in December last year claiming that the tracker was a “direct personal safety risk.” Prior to this suspension, Musk said he wouldn’t ban the account as part of his “commitment to free speech.” Sweeney also runs several other trackers on Instagram, Facebook, and Bluesky that monitor the flight paths of private jets for notables like Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Jeff Bezos, and Kim Kardashian. These automated “bot” accounts created by Sweeney pull together publicly available air travel data to chart the locations of the aircraft. The Twitter accounts associated with these trackers were also suspended.\n\nPrior to his @ElonJet Twitter account being suspended, Sweeney once rejected Musk’s $5,000 offer to remove the tracker, requesting that the billionaire increase the offer to $50,000 and provide him with an internship. By calling out Zuckerberg, Sweeney seems to be goading the Meta CEO into taking similar action.\n\n\"Sweeney still has a Twitter account tracking Musk’s private jet, only now with a 24-hour delay\"\n\nShortly after Sweeney’s @ElonJet Twitter account was suspended last year, Musk tweeted, “Any account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended, as it is a physical safety violation. This includes posting links to sites with real-time location info.” Twitter’s private information and media policy was also updated in December to specify that sharing publicly available location information is only permitted after a “reasonable time has elapsed” — which allowed Sweeney to create a new Twitter account to track Musk’s jet with a 24-hour delay.\n\nMeta’s recently launched Threads platform appears to be the most significant Twitter rival to date, having amassed 100 million users just days after its release. And that’s without the app being available in the Europe Union yet while it seeks regulatory approval under the EU’s data privacy legislation. Sweeney’s decision to resurrect his real-time Elon jet tracker on Threads could further inflame tensions between the two social media giants. Twitter has already threatened to sue Meta, claiming that Threads was created using Twitter’s trade secrets and intellectual property, and Musk and Zuckerberg appear to be serious about fighting each other in a cage match.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"Twitter’s traffic is taking a dive, according to Cloudflare’s CEO.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-07-09T19:09:06.216Z","dateModified":"2023-07-09T19:09:06.216Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/9/23788906/twitters-traffic-is-taking-a-dive-according-to-cloudflares-ceo","author":[],"articleBody":"Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince posted a graph to both Threads and Twitter today (Cloudflare’s communications VP Daniella Vallurupalli confirmed it was him) showing what he says is Twitter’s DNS ranking from January to now.\n\nIt’s, uh, not a great story!\n\nTwitter alternative Threads, meanwhile, has been growing explosively — it’s less than three million from the 100 million user mark.

It even dropped “News” from the name of the Facebook Feed last year. The company also responded to a new Canadian law that would require it to pay for local news by saying it will yank news from Facebook and Instagram in the country. \n\nThe Instagram boss later clarified his initial response, stating that while Threads won’t “discourage or down-rank news or politics,” it won’t “court” them as Facebook has in the past. “If we are honest, we were too quick to promise too much to the industry on Facebook in the early 2010s, and it would be a mistake to repeat that,” Mosseri said.\n\nWhile Threads is assuredly a take on Twitter, a platform tying itself in knots under new ownership, Mosseri is apparently thinking much bigger. Following along with his boss, Mark Zuckerberg's statement about finding a “clear path to 1 billion people,” Mosseri said:\n\n\u003e The goal isn’t to replace Twitter. The goal is to create a public square for communities on Instagram that never really embraced Twitter and for communities on Twitter (and other platforms) that are interested in a less angry place for conversations, but not all of Twitter.\n\nThreads launched on Wednesday and has proven to be a big hit; it’s already surpassed 70 million signups. But the vibe, so far, is decidedly not like what you might be familiar with from Twitter: the only available feed is an algorithmic one, and that feed is already flooded with celebrities and brands. \n\n[Media: https://www.threads.net/t/CuZ6opKtHva/]\n\nStill, it seems inevitable that politics and news will trickle onto Threads in some way, especially if politicians and journalists use the platform during the 2024 presidential election cycle. And Instagram is working on a feed just for people you follow and a chronological feed, which, at least for me, should make Threads a much more useful place to find news. But it sounds like Instagram won’t be going out of its way to make Threads what Twitter once was — so don’t get your hopes up for some kind of Thread-Deck.\n\nUpdate July 7th, 5:28PM ET: Added further context from Mosseri.\n"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Verge","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24015294/verge_duet_google_news.png","width":250,"height":50}},"headline":"The Elon Musk private jet tracker was on Threads, but not anymore.","alternativeHeadline":"","datePublished":"2023-07-07T17:36:34.386Z","dateModified":"2023-07-07T17:36:34.386Z","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/7/23787101/the-elon-musk-private-jet-tracker-was-on-threads-but-not-anymore","author":[],"articleBody":"Jack Sweeney made his @ElonMusksJet account one of the first 70 million or so on Threads and spoke to Insider about it yesterday.
